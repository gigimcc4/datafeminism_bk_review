Crowd explicit sentiment analysis.,"Montejo-Ráez, A.; Díaz-Galiano, M.C.; Martínez-Santiago, F.; Ureña-López, L.A.","With the rapid growth of data generated by social web applications new paradigms in the generation of knowledge are opening. This paper introduces Crowd Explicit Sentiment Analysis (CESA) as an approach for sentiment analysis in social media environments. Similar to Explicit Semantic Analysis, microblog posts are indexed by a predefined collection of documents. In CESA, these documents are built up from common emotional expressions in social streams. In this way, texts are projected to feelings or emotions . This process is performed within a Latent Semantic Analysis. A few simple regular expressions (e.g. “I feel X” , considering X a term representing an emotion or feeling) are used to scratch the enormous flow of micro-blog posts to generate a textual representation of an emotional state with clear polarity value (e.g. angry, happy, sad, confident, etc. ). In this way, new posts can be indexed by these feelings according to the distance to their textual representation. The approach is suitable in many scenarios dealing with social media publications and can be implemented in other languages with little effort. In particular, we have evaluated the system on Polarity Classification with both English and Spanish data sets. The results show that CESA is a valid solution for sentiment analysis and that similar approaches for model building from the continuous flow of posts could be exploited in other scenarios.",2014,10//,Knowledge-Based Systems,ai,ai,69,,134-139,,,,#6618,Montejo-Ráez 2014,,
Docode 5: Building a real-world plagiarism detection system.,"Pizarro V., Gaspar; Velásquez, Juan D.","Plagiarism refers to the appropriation of someone else’s ideas and expression. Its ubiquity makes it necessary to counter it, and invites the development of commercial systems to do so. In this document we introduce Docode 5, a system for plagiarism detection that can perform analyses on the World Wide Web and on user-defined collections, and can be used as a decision support system. Our contribution in this document is to present this system in all its range of components, from the algorithms used in it to the user interfaces, and the issues with deployment on a commercial scale at an algorithmic and architectural level. We ran performance tests on the plagiarism detection algorithm showing an acceptable performance from an academic and commercial point of view, and load tests on the deployed system, showing that we can benefit from a distributed deployment. With this, we conclude we can adapt algorithms made for small-scale plagiarism detection to a commercial-scale system.",2017,09//,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,engineering,eng_ai,64,,261-271,,,,#6111,Pizarro 2017,,

A proposal for the development of adaptive spoken interfaces to access the Web.,"Griol, David; Molina, José Manuel; Callejas, Zoraida","Spoken dialog systems have been proposed as a solution to facilitate a more natural human–machine interaction. In this paper, we propose a framework to model the user׳s intention during the dialog and adapt the dialog model dynamically to the user needs and preferences, thus developing more efficient, adapted, and usable spoken dialog systems. Our framework employs statistical models based on neural networks that take into account the history of the dialog up to the current dialog state in order to predict the user׳s intention and the next system response. We describe our proposal and detail its application in the Let׳s Go spoken dialog system. ",2015,09/02/,Neurocomputing,technology,tech_nc,163,,56-68,,,,#6072,Griol 2015,,
Computer-based working memory training in children with mild intellectual disability.,"Delavarian, Mona; Bokharaeian, Behrouz; Towhidkhah, Farzad; Gharibzadeh, Shahriar","We designed a working memory (WM) training programme in game framework for mild intellectually disabled students. Twenty-four students participated as test and control groups. The auditory and visual–spatial WM were assessed by primary test, which included computerised Wechsler numerical forward and backward sub-tests and secondary tests, which contained three parts: dual visual–spatial test, auditory test and a one-syllable word recalling test. The results showed significant difference between WM capacity in the intellectually disabled children and normal ones (p-value < 0.00001). Visual–spatial WM, auditory WM and speaking were improved in the trained group. Four tests showed significant differences between pre-test and post-tests. The trained group showed more improvements in forward tasks. The trained participant's processing speed increased with training. We found that school is the best place for training. More comprehensive human–computer interfaces could be suitable for intellectually disabled students with visual and auditory impairments and problems in motor skills.",2015,01//,Early Child Development & Care,education,edu_early,185,1,66-74,,,,#6576,Delavarian 2015,,
Sequential deep learning from NTSB reports for aviation safety prognosis.,"Zhang, Xiaoge; Srinivasan, Prabhakar; Mahadevan, Sankaran","• Sequential deep learning models are developed for performing prognosis of adverse aviation events. • We compare the performance of classification models trained with event sequences and text narratives. • The developed model can be used for prognosis with partial and evolving event sequences. In this paper, we apply a set of data-mining and sequential deep learning techniques to accident investigation reports published by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in support of the prognosis of adverse events. Our focus is on learning with text data that describes the sequences of events. NTSB creates post hoc investigation reports which contain raw text narratives of their investigation and their corresponding concise event sequences. Classification models are developed for passenger air carriers, that take either an observed sequence of events or the corresponding raw text narrative as input and make predictions regarding whether an accident or an incident is the likely outcome, whether the aircraft would be damaged or not and whether any fatalities are likely or not. The classification models are developed using Word Embedding and the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The proposed methodology is implemented in two steps: (i) transform the NTSB data extracts into labeled dataset for building supervised machine learning models; and (ii) develop deep learning (DL) models for performing prognosis of adverse events like accidents, aircraft damage or fatalities. We also develop a prototype for an interactive query interface for end-users to test various scenarios including complete or partial event sequences or narratives and get predictions regarding the adverse events. The development of sequential deep learning models facilitates safety professionals in auditing, reviewing, and analyzing accident investigation reports, performing what-if scenario analyses to quantify the contributions of various hazardous events to the occurrence of aviation accidents/incidents.

How Does Prior Knowledge Influence Eye Fixations and Sequences of Cognitive and Metacognitive SRL Processes during Learning with an Intelligent Tutoring System?,"Taub, Michelle; Azevedo, Roger","The goal of this study was to use eye-tracking and log-file data to investigate the impact of prior knowledge on college students' (N = 194, with a subset of n = 30 for eye tracking and sequence mining analyses) fixations on (i.e., looking at) self-regulated learning-related areas of interest (i.e., specific locations on the interface) and on the sequences of engaging in cognitive and metacognitive self-regulated learning processes during learning with MetaTutor, an Intelligent Tutoring System that teaches students about the human circulatory system. Results revealed that there were no significant differences in fixations on single areas of interest by the prior knowledge group students were assigned to; however there were significant differences in fixations on pairs of areas of interest, as evidenced by eye-tracking data. Furthermore, there were significant differences in sequential patterns of engaging in cognitive and metacognitive self-regulated learning processes by students' prior knowledge group, as evidenced from log-file data. Specifically, students with high prior knowledge engaged in processes containing cognitive strategies and metacognitive strategies whereas students with low prior knowledge did not. These results have implications for designing adaptive intelligent tutoring systems that provide individualized scaffolding and feedback based on individual differences, such as levels of prior knowledge.

"Toward ""On‐Demand"" Materials Synthesis and Scientific Discovery through Intelligent Robots.","Li, Jiagen; Tu, Yuxiao; Liu, Rulin; Lu, Yihua; Zhu, Xi","A Materials Acceleration Operation System (MAOS) is designed, with unique language and compiler architecture. MAOS integrates with virtual reality (VR), collaborative robots, and a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme for autonomous materials synthesis, properties investigations, and self‐optimized quality assurance. After training through VR, MAOS can work independently for labor and intensively reduces the time cost. Under the RL framework, MAOS also inspires the improved nucleation theory, and feedback for the optimal strategy, which can satisfy the demand on both of the CdSe quantum dots (QDs) emission wavelength and size distribution quality. Moreover, it can work well for extensive coverages of inorganic nanomaterials. MAOS frees the experimental researchers out of the tedious labor as well as the extensive exploration of optimal reaction conditions. This work provides a walking example for the ""On‐Demand"" materials synthesis system, and demonstrates how artificial intelligence technology can reshape traditional materials science research in the future.",2020,04/08/,Advanced Science,science,sci_multi,7,7,1-11,,,,#5982,Li 2020,,
SWIFT-Active Screener: Accelerated document screening through active learning and integrated recall estimation.,"Howard, Brian E.; Phillips, Jason; Tandon, Arpit; Maharana, Adyasha; Elmore, Rebecca; Mav, Deepak; Sedykh, Alex; Thayer, Kristina; Merrick, B. Alex; Walker, Vickie; Rooney, Andrew; Shah, Ruchir R.","• Machine learning tools can reduce screening burden in systematic reviews. • SWIFT-Active Screener is a machine learning web app for document screening. • It uses one model to prioritize documents and another to estimate recall. • On average, 95% of relevant articles are revealed after screening 40% of the total. • Savings are increased on larger reviews with more references to screen. In the screening phase of systematic review, researchers use detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria to decide whether each article in a set of candidate articles is relevant to the research question under consideration. A typical review may require screening thousands or tens of thousands of articles in and can utilize hundreds of person-hours of labor. Here we introduce SWIFT-Active Screener, a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application, designed to reduce the overall screening burden required during this resource-intensive phase of the review process. To prioritize articles for review, SWIFT-Active Screener uses active learning, a type of machine learning that incorporates user feedback during screening. Meanwhile, a negative binomial model is employed to estimate the number of relevant articles remaining in the unscreened document list. Using a simulation involving 26 diverse systematic review datasets that were previously screened by reviewers, we evaluated both the document prioritization and recall estimation methods. On average, 95% of the relevant articles were identified after screening only 40% of the total reference list. In the 5 document sets with 5,000 or more references, 95% recall was achieved after screening only 34% of the available references, on average. Furthermore, the recall estimator we have proposed provides a useful, conservative estimate of the percentage of relevant documents identified during the screening process. SWIFT-Active Screener can result in significant time savings compared to traditional screening and the savings are increased for larger project sizes. Moreover, the integration of explicit recall estimation during screening solves an important challenge faced by all machine learning systems for document screening: when to stop screening a prioritized reference list. The software is currently available in the form of a multi-user, collaborative, online web application.",2020,05//,Environment International,science,sci_env_health,138,,N.PAG-N.PAG,,,,#5981,Howard 2020,,

Detecting and visualizing hate speech in social media: A cyber Watchdog for surveillance.,"Modha, Sandip; Majumder, Prasenjit; Mandl, Thomas; Mandalia, Chintak","• Developed browser plugins to visualize hate speech live on Facebook & Twitter. • Designed proof of concepts for personalized dashboards for Twitter & Instagram. • Optimized classifiers for Hate Speech with tests on standard datasets. • Application areas for the tool are discussed. The multi-fold growth of the social media user-base fuelled a substantial increase in the amount of hate speech posts on social media platforms. The enormous data volume makes it hard to capture such cases and either moderate or delete them. This paper presents an approach to detect and visualize online aggression, a special case of hate speech, over social media. Aggression is categorized into overtly aggressive (OAG), covertly aggressive (CAG), and non-aggressive labels (NAG). We have designed a user interface based on a web browser plugin over Facebook and Twitter to visualize the aggressive comments posted on the Social media user's timelines. This plugin interface might help to the security agency to keep a tab on the social media stream. It also provides citizens with a tool that is typically only available for large enterprises. The availability of such a tool alleviates the technological imbalance between industry and citizens. Besides, the system might be helpful to the research community to create further tools and prepare weakly labeled training data in a few minutes using comments posted by users on celebrity's Facebook, Twitter timeline. We have reported the results on a newly created dataset of user comments posted on Facebook and Twitter using our proposed plugins and the standard Trolling Aggression Cyberbullying 2018 (TRAC) dataset in English and code-mixed Hindi. Various classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic regression, deep learning model based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Attention-based model, and the recently proposed BERT pre-trained language model by Google AI, have been used for aggression classification. The weighted F1-score of around 0.64 and 0.62 is achieved on TRAC Facebook English and Hindi datasets while on Twitter English and Hindi datasets, the weighted F1-score is 0.58 and 0.50, respectively.

Design Guidelines and Empirical Case Study for Scaling Authentic Inquiry-based Science Learning via Open Online Courses and Interactive Biology Cloud Labs.,"Hossain, Zahid; Bumbacher, Engin; Brauneis, Alison; Diaz, Monica; Saltarelli, Andy; Blikstein, Paulo; Riedel-Kruse, Ingmar H.","The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and other national frameworks are calling for much more sophisticated approaches to STEM education, centered around the integration of complex experimentation (including real labs, not just simulations), data collection and analysis, modeling, and data-driven argumentation, i.e., students can behave like real scientists. How to implement such complex approaches in scalable ways is an unsolved challenge - both for presential and distance education. Here we report on the iterative design and large-scale deployment of an open online course with a “biology cloud experimentation lab” (using living cells) that engaged remote learners (> 300 students) in the scientific practices of experimentation, modeling and data analysis to investigate the phototaxis of a microorganism. We demonstrate (1) the robustness and scalability of the cloud lab technology (> 2,300 experiments run), (2) the design principles and synergistic integration of multiple UI and learning activities and suitable data formats to facilitate NGSS-aligned science activities, and (3) design features that leverages the natural variability of real biology experiments to instigate authentic inquiry.

"The human touch: How non-expert users perceive, interpret, and fix topic models.","Lee, Tak Yeon; Smith, Alison; Seppi, Kevin; Elmqvist, Niklas; Boyd-Graber, Jordan; Findlater, Leah","Topic modeling is a common tool for understanding large bodies of text, but is typically provided as a “take it or leave it” proposition. Incorporating human knowledge in unsupervised learning is a promising approach to create high-quality topic models. Existing interactive systems and modeling algorithms support a wide range of refinement operations to express feedback. However, these systems’ interactions are primarily driven by algorithmic convenience, ignoring users who may lack expertise in topic modeling. To better understand how non-expert users understand, assess, and refine topics, we conducted two user studies—an in-person interview study and an online crowdsourced study. These studies demonstrate a disconnect between what non-expert users want and the complex, low-level operations that current interactive systems support. In particular, our findings include: (1) analysis of how non-expert users perceive topic models; (2) characterization of primary refinement operations expected by non-expert users and ordered by relative preference; (3) further evidence of the benefits of supporting users in directly refining a topic model; (4) design implications for future human-in-the-loop topic modeling interfaces.",2017,09//,International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,engineering,eng_hci,105,,28-42,,,,#6116,Lee 2017,,
Head mouse control system for people with disabilities.,"Abiyev, Rahib H.; Arslan, Murat","In this paper, a human–machine interface for disabled people with spinal cord injuries is proposed. The designed human–machine interface is an assistive system that uses head movements and blinking for mouse control. In the proposed system, by moving one's head, the user moves the mouse pointer to the required coordinates and then blinks to send commands. The considered head mouse control is based on image processing including facial recognition, in particular, the recognition of the eyes, mouth, and nose. The proposed recognition system is based on the convolutional neural network, which uses the low‐quality images that are captured by a computer's camera. The convolutional neural network (CNN) includes convolutional layers, a pooling layer, and a fully connected network. The CNN transforms the head movements to the actual coordinates of the mouse. The designed system allows people with disabilities to control a mouse pointer with head movements and to control mouse buttons with blinks. The results of the experiments demonstrate that this system is robust and accurate. This invention allows people with disabilities to freely control mouse cursors and mouse buttons without wearing any equipment.",2020,02//,Expert Systems,engineering,eng_hci,37,1,N.PAG-N.PAG,,,,#6244,Abiyev 2020,,
A Smart Home Test Bed for Undergraduate Education to Bridge the Curriculum Gap From Traditional Power Systems to Modernized Smart Grids.,"Hu, Qinran; Li, Fangxing; Chen, Chien-fei","There is a worldwide trend to modernize old power grid infrastructures to form future smart grids, which will achieve efficient, flexible energy consumption by using the latest technologies in communication, computing, and control. Smart grid initiatives are moving power systems curricula toward smart grids. Although the components of smart grids fall within the broader discipline of electrical and computer engineering, undergraduate students are rarely assigned single design projects that require classic power systems knowledge combined with communication, computing, and control. Therefore, as a significant step toward potential curriculum changes, this paper presents such a project, a smart home test bed based on the pedagogical model of project-based learning (PBL) for undergraduate education. The proposed test bed allows undergraduates to gain key knowledge in smart grid topics, such as flattening demand peaks, real-time price response, wireless sensor networks, machine learning, pattern recognition, embedded system programming, user interface design, circuit design, and databases. This is well aligned with smart grid initiatives and provides a platform for students to develop their creativity in engineering design.

Effects of adaptive training on metacognitive knowledge monitoring ability in computer-based learning.,"Kautzmann, Tiago Roberto; Jaques, Patricia A.","Abstract An experimental study was conducted with 8th grade students (N = 41), ranging from 13 to 14 years old, whereby they solved first-degree equations using a step-based intelligent tutoring system. The aim of the study is to assess the training of the metacognitive knowledge monitoring ability carried out by an animated pedagogical agent integrated into the tutoring system. Students from the experimental group received metacognitive instructions from the agent, as well as some hints and feedback, whereas those from the control group received only hint-messages and feedback. Pretest and posttest sessions were carried out in order to collect the metacognitive knowledge monitoring ability indexes, as well as the students' performance grades for first degree equations solving. The results indicated that students who received metacognitive instruction presented greater improvement on metacognitive knowledge monitoring ability indexes. The study also monitored students' performance in solving equations during experimental sessions and found that those who received metacognitive instructions completed more equations correctly. This paper also discusses the implications of the results for the theory of metacognitive knowledge monitoring ability. Highlights • An agent that trains the knowledge monitoring ability is evaluated. • The agent's training can improve students' knowledge monitoring ability. • The agent's training can improve students' learning performance. • A correlation between students' performance and metacognitive ability is found.

Cyber-physical postural training system for construction workers.,"Akanmu, Abiola A.; Olayiwola, Johnson; Ogunseiju, Omobolanle; McFeeters, David","Risks of work-related musculoskeletal injuries can be reduced by adequately training construction workers on performing work in safe postures. Traditional training approaches provide limited support for performing work tasks and receiving real-time feedback. This paper describes a cyber-physical postural training environment where workers can practice to perform work with reduced ergonomic risks. The proposed system uses wearable sensors, Vive trackers, machine learning and virtual reality to track body kinematics, and engagement with physical construction resources, and provides feedback via an interactive user interface. The postural training system was developed for training workers engaged in wood frame construction. User study of the effectiveness of the feedback and user interface was conducted. Findings showed that the user interface was perceived as convenient with limited interference with the workspace. The feedback was understandable in learning risks associated with participant's postures. Further research will involve conducting formative workload evaluation of the user interface and developing a reinforcement learning model for adapting the feedback based on the state of learning. • This paper delineates a cyber-physical system for training workers on safe work postures. • Development of the postural training system for wood frame construction is presented. • Real-time postural feedback is provided via an interactive user interface augmented on the field of view. • Usability study of the effectiveness of the user interface and the feedback is presented. • Contribution of this study is in demonstrating the efficacy of the user interface in providing feedback on safe work performance",2020,09//,Automation in Construction,technology,tech_constr,117,,N.PAG-N.PAG,,,,#6021,Akanmu 2020,,

Using artificial intelligence for modeling of the realistic animal behaviors in a virtual island.,"Turan, Ertan; Çetin, Gürcan","• A virtual environment modeled in unity 3D platform, and user – virtual character interactions have been enabled with artificial intelligence. • Fuzzy logic method is used to create action states of the virtual animals. • A developed gyroscopic equipment enables to user an eagles' perspective which called 'Flight Simulation'. • The fuzzy logic strategy has a good performance to create AI-based animals. • With the proposed model, user – virtual environment interaction is increased and presented more realistic experience. The remarkable development of the computer graphic techniques enables the creation and management of more realistic games and virtual environments. However, placing the Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a virtual world get making these environments both more interactive and more believable. One of the most ambitious goals of the AI is to create virtual worlds in which a big number of virtual characters or humans being interacted and behave in an autonomous way. For this purpose, placing embodied intelligence characters in a virtual world offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the AI concept. This paper introduces a Virtual Island developed in an innovative way based on fuzzy rules at the user interaction mechanism. We have used fuzzy tactics to create AI-based animals having various behavior types from an eagles' perspective which called 'Flight Simulation'. The simulation utilizes an eagle flying over the airspace of the Island of Chios. The AI on the ground is triggered by other animals when they enter a radius area with a certain speed defined in the software. It then decides how to behave according to health, behavior type and confidence level. Also, there is non-AI sparrow herd placed over the island to make user understand how fast he is and give the user sense of speed what can be called as an in-project feature. Consequently, the used Fuzzy Tactics have been tested in realized Unity 3D simulation.

Robots Show Us How to Teach Them: Feedback from Robots Shapes Tutoring Behavior during Action Learning.,"Vollmer, Anna-Lisa; Mühlig, Manuel; Steil, Jochen J.; Pitsch, Karola; Fritsch, Jannik; Rohlfing, Katharina J.; Wrede, Britta","Robot learning by imitation requires the detection of a tutor's action demonstration and its relevant parts. Current approaches implicitly assume a unidirectional transfer of knowledge from tutor to learner. The presented work challenges this predominant assumption based on an extensive user study with an autonomously interacting robot. We show that by providing feedback, a robot learner influences the human tutor's movement demonstrations in the process of action learning. We argue that the robot's feedback strongly shapes how tutors signal what is relevant to an action and thus advocate a paradigm shift in robot action learning research toward truly interactive systems learning in and benefiting from interaction",2014,03//,PLoS ONE,science,sci,9,3,1-12,,,,#6093,Vollmer 2014,,
How universal can an intelligence test be?,"Dowe, David L; Hernández-Orallo, José","The notion of a universal intelligence test has been recently advocated as a means to assess humans, non-human animals and machines in an integrated, uniform way. While the main motivation has been the development of machine intelligence tests, the mere concept of a universal test has many implications in the way human intelligence tests are understood, and their relation to other tests in comparative psychology and animal cognition. From this diversity of subjects in the natural and artificial kingdoms, the very possibility of constructing a universal test is still controversial. In this paper we rephrase the question of whether universal intelligence tests are possible or not into the question of how universal intelligence tests can be, in terms of subjects, interfaces and resolutions. We discuss the feasibility and difficulty of universal tests depending on several levels according to what is taken for granted: the communication milieu, the resolution, the reward system or the agent itself. We argue that such tests must be highly adaptive, i.e. that tasks, resolution, rewards and communication have to be adapted according to how the evaluated agent is reacting and performing. Even so, the most general expression of a universal test may not be feasible (and, at best, might only be theoretically semi-computable). Nonetheless, in general, we can analyze the universality in terms of some traits that lead to several levels of universality and set the quest for universal tests as a progressive rather than absolute goal.",2014,02//,Adaptive Behavior,ai,ai,22,1,51-69,,,,#5835,Dowe 2014,,
EEG-based approach for recognizing human social emotion perception.,"Zhu, Li; Su, Chongwei; Zhang, Jianhai; Cui, Gaochao; Cichocki, Andrzej; Zhou, Changle; Li, Junhua","Social emotion perception plays an important role in our daily social interactions and is involved in the treatments for mental disorders. Hyper-scanning technique enables to measure brain activities simultaneously from two or more persons, which was employed in this study to explore social emotion perception. We analyzed the recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) to explore emotion perception in terms of event related potential (ERP) and phase synchronization, and classified emotion categories based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The results showed that (1) ERP was significantly different among four emotion categories (i.e., anger, disgust, neutral, and happy), but there was no significant difference for ERP in the comparison of rating orders (the order of rating actions of the paired participants); (2) the intra-brain phase lag index (PLI) was higher than the inter-brain PLI but its number of connections exhibiting significant difference was less in all typical frequency bands (from delta to gamma); (3) the emotion classification accuracy of inter-PLI-Conv outperformed that of intra-PLI-Conv for all cases of using each frequency band (five frequency bands totally).

Scoring and assessment in medical VR training simulators with dynamic time series classification.,"Vaughan, Neil; Gabrys, Bogdan","This research proposes and evaluates scoring and assessment methods for Virtual Reality (VR) training simulators. VR simulators capture detailed n-dimensional human motion data which is useful for performance analysis. Custom made medical haptic VR training simulators were developed and used to record data from 271 trainees of multiple clinical experience levels. DTW Multivariate Prototyping (DTW-MP) is proposed. VR data was classified as Novice, Intermediate or Expert. Accuracy of algorithms applied for time-series classification were: dynamic time warping 1-nearest neighbor (DTW-1NN) 60%, nearest centroid SoftDTW classification 77.5%, Deep Learning: ResNet 85%, FCN 75%, CNN 72.5% and MCDCNN 28.5%. Expert VR data recordings can be used for guidance of novices. Assessment feedback can help trainees to improve skills and consistency. Motion analysis can identify different techniques used by individuals. Mistakes can be detected dynamically in real-time, raising alarms to prevent injuries. • Skill assessment methods for adaptive Virtual Reality simulator training. • Developed methods for assessing the skill using time series trajectories. • Clustering and classification used to assess skill from multivariate time series. • Dynamic Time Warping used to compare and prototype time series clusters. • Comparison between data collected from novices and expert clinicians",2020,09//,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,engineering,eng_ai,94,,N.PAG-N.PAG,,,,#6508,Vaughan 2020,,
Argumentation Scheme-Based Argument Generation to Support Feedback in Educational Argument Modeling Systems.,"Green, Nancy","This paper describes an educational argument modeling system, GAIL (Genetics Argumentation Inquiry Learning). Using GAIL's graphical interface, learners can select from possible argument content elements (hypotheses, data, etc.) displayed on the screen with which to construct argument diagrams. Unlike previous systems, GAIL uses domain-independent argumentation schemes to generate expert arguments as a knowledge source. By comparing the learner's argument diagram to a generated argument, GAIL can provide problem-specific feedback on both the structure and meaning of the learner's argument, e.g., that the learner's argument contains an irrelevant premise. To generate arguments, the argumentation schemes are instantiated from causal domain models specified by lesson authors. Thus, this approach to generating expert arguments has the potential to be used in other domains. In this paper we describe use of GAIL's Authoring Tool to create the domain model and content elements to be provided for a specific lesson, how expert arguments are generated in GAIL, and how the feedback is produced. As GAIL is a work-in-progress, the paper also describes plans for the next design iteration.

Developing enhanced conversational agents for social virtual worlds.,"Griol, David; Sanchis, Araceli; Molina, José Manuel; Callejas, Zoraida","In this paper, we present a methodology for the development of embodied conversational agents for social virtual worlds. The agents provide multimodal communication with their users in which speech interaction is included. Our proposal combines different techniques related to Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Affective Computing, and User Modeling. A statistical methodology has been developed to model the system conversational behavior, which is learned from an initial corpus and improved with the knowledge acquired from the successive interactions. In addition, the selection of the next system response is adapted considering information stored into user's profiles and also the emotional contents detected in the user's utterances. Our proposal has been evaluated with the successful development of an embodied conversational agent which has been placed in the Second Life social virtual world. The avatar includes the different models and interacts with the users who inhabit the virtual world in order to provide academic information. The experimental results show that the agent's conversational behavior adapts successfully to the specific characteristics of users interacting in such environments.",2019,08/18/,Neurocomputing,technology,tech_nc,354,,27-40,,,,#4811,Griol 2019,,
Structured learning for spoken language understanding in human-robot interaction.,"Bastianelli, Emanuele; Castellucci, Giuseppe; Croce, Danilo; Basili, Roberto; Nardi, Daniele","Robots are slowly becoming a part of everyday life, being marketed for commercial applications such as telepresence, cleaning or entertainment. Thus, the ability to interact via natural language with non-expert users is becoming a key requirement. Even if user utterances can be efficiently recognized and transcribed by automatic speech recognition systems, several issues arise in translating them into suitable robotic actions and most of the existing solutions are strictly related to a specific scenario. In this paper, we present an approach to the design of natural language interfaces for human robot interaction, to translate spoken commands into computational structures that enable the robot to execute the intended request. The proposed solution is achieved by combining a general theory of language semantics, i.e. frame semantics, with state-of-the-art methods for robust spoken language understanding, based on structured learning algorithms. The adopted data driven paradigm allows the development of a fully functional natural language processing chain, that can be initialized by re-using available linguistic tools and resources. In addition, it can be also specialized by providing small sets of examples representative of a target newer domain. A systematic benchmarking resource, in terms of a rich and multi-layered spoken corpus has also been created and it has been used to evaluate the natural language processing chain. Our results show that our processing chain, trained with generic resources, provides a solid baseline for command understanding in a service robot domain. Moreover, when domain-dependent resources are provided to the system, the accuracy of the achieved interpretation always improves.",2017,06//,International Journal of Robotics Research,technology,tech_robot,36,5-7,660-683,,,,#5474,Bastianelli 2017,,
Mental effort detection using EEG data in E-learning contexts.,"Lin, Fu-Ren; Kao, Chien-Min","E-learning becomes an alternative learning mode since the prevalence of the Internet. Especially, the advance of MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) technology enables a course to enroll tens of thousands of online learners. How to improve learners' online learning experiences on MOOC platforms becomes a crucial task for platform providers. In this research, based on Cognitive Load Theory, we built a system to capture and tag a user's mental states while s/he is watching online videos with a commercial EEG device, and used different normalization schemes and time window lengths to process EEG signals recorded from the EEG device. Finally, we adopted different supervised learning algorithms to train and test the classifiers, and then evaluated their classification performance. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively process EEG data to train classifiers, which achieve high accuracy, precision and recall rates compared with those of previous studies. This system can effectively facilitate users' self-awareness of mental efforts in online learning contexts to enable the automatic feedback in synchronous and asynchronous learning contexts, especially taking MOOCs as an example.",2018,07//,Computers & Education,education,edu_computr,122,,63-79,,,,#6181,Lin 2018,,
Scaffolding student teachers' information‐seeking behaviours with a network‐based tutoring system.,"Poitras, Eric; Mayne, Zachary; Huang, Lingyun; Udy, Laurel; Lajoie, Susanne","Student teachers' instructional planning requires them to regulate certain aspects of their own learning while designing lessons. The aim of this study is to support student teachers' self‐regulated learning through the convergence effect, where network‐based tutors are designed to optimize system recommendations of online resources based on information‐seeking behaviours. A total of 68 student teachers were randomly assigned to either a dynamic or static version of nBrowser, which converged a network or not towards an optimal configuration. The structural equation model suggests that student teachers spent less time during the learning session using the dynamic version of nBrowser. Although student teachers were found to be more efficient in seeking and acquiring information and reported knowledge gains, they failed to perform better than those assigned to the static condition on the lesson plan design task. We discuss the implications for the convergence effect in the context of network‐based tutors. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Preservice teachers require resources to plan classroom activities, for example, open educational resources available on the web.Preservice teachers may lack the prerequisite skills to regulate their own learning, in particular, to seek and acquire information from online resources in an efficient manner.Computer‐based learning environments can be designed to support self‐regulated learning while navigating hypermedia. What this paper adds: Intelligent web browsers can leverage the linguistic features and information‐seeking behaviours of preservice teachers to personalize recommendations of online resources.Recommender systems stands to improve the efficiency of teachers' self‐regulated learning, in particular, their efforts to seek and acquire online resources. Implications for practice and/or policy: Efforts should be made to make artificial intelligence tools in education broadly available to teachers, including lesson planning tools that leverage open educational resources.Tools that support teachers in seeking and acquiring information may benefit their professional development by enabling them to allocate more attentional resources to other aspects of teaching.

"Electronic storybook design, kindergartners' visual attention, and print awareness: An eye-tracking investigation.","Liao, Chia-Ning; Chang, Kuo-En; Huang, Yu-Ching; Sung, Yao-Ting","The purpose of this study was to understand children's visual attention during shared storybook reading when the print and picture area sizes are identical, as well as to understand which electronic storybook design is best able to increase children's attention to the print and their print awareness. To this end, we modified the electronic storybook's design, measured children's print awareness, and used an eye-tracker to measure children's visual attention during reading. Sixty-one 4–5 year old Taiwanese children's data were analyzed in this study. This study was conducted over a 6-week period: one week for pretest, four weeks of intervention, and one week for posttest. After the pretest stage, the kindergartners were split into three groups: traditional storybook, highlight synchronization (implicit instruction), and print discussion (explicit instruction). The results suggested that: First, when the print and picture area sizes were identical, children spent more than 19% of their time looking at the print area, substantially higher than previous studies (e.g. Evans & Saint-Aubin, 2005; Justice, Skibbe, Canning, & Lankford, 2005; Roy-Charland, Perron, Boulard, Chamberland, & Hoffman, 2015); second, the highlight synchronization design did entice children to look at the print more (from 19% to 38% reading time); third, exposure to either the reading highlight synchronization or the print discussion storybook designs for four weeks improved the children's print awareness. • Children spent more than 19% of their time looking at the print area, substantially higher than previous studies. • The highlight synchronization design did entice children to look at the print more. • Reading the highlight synchronization or print discussion storybook for four weeks improved the children's print awareness.]",2020,01/15/,Computers & Education,education,edu_computr,144,,N.PAG-N.PAG,,,,#5833,Liao 2020,,

In this study, we identified and compared the moral considerations associated with the introduction of social robots in primary education from the viewpoint of direct and indirect stakeholders by conducting focus group sessions (N = 118). In total, we identified and compared stakeholder considerations related to 17 moral values. Overall, each of the stakeholder groups considered social robots a potentially valuable tool for education. Many similarities and only few conflicting views across the various stakeholder groups were found. Particularly among the teachers, parents, and policymakers, there were many similarities on the issues reported and their considerations were often aligned. These insights into the moral considerations of the various stakeholders involved, provide a solid base to develop guidelines for implementing social robots in education as requested by scholars and society. • This study compared the moral considerations on social robots in primary education of different stakeholder groups. • We identified 17 moral values that might be affected by the implementation of social robots in primary education. • All stakeholders considered social robots as a potentially valuable tool for education. • Particularly teachers, parents and policymakers agreed on issues, such as usefulness, responsibility and accountability. • Results are important for the responsible design and use of social robots in the educational system.

Correction to: Avoiding Help Avoidance: Using Interface Design Changes to Promote Unsolicited Hint Usage in an Intelligent Tutor.,"Maniktala, Mehak; Cody, Christa; Barnes, Tiffany; Chi, Min","A Correction to this paper has been published: https://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-020-00232-0Within intelligent tutoring systems, considerable research has investigated hints, including how to generate data-driven hints, what hint content to present, and when to provide hints for optimal learning outcomes. However, less attention has been paid to how hints are presented. In this paper, we propose a new hint delivery mechanism called “Assertions” for providing unsolicited hints in a data-driven intelligent tutor. Assertions are partially-worked example steps designed to appear within a student workspace, and in the same format as student-derived steps, to show students a possible subgoal leading to the solution. We hypothesized that Assertions can help address the well-known hint avoidance problem. In systems that only provide hints upon request, hint avoidance results in students not receiving hints when they are needed. Our unsolicited Assertions do not seek to improve student help-seeking, but rather seek to ensure students receive the help they need. We contrast Assertions with Messages, text-based, unsolicited hints that appear after student inactivity. Our results show that Assertions significantly increase unsolicited hint usage compared to Messages. Further, they show a significant aptitude-treatment interaction between Assertions and prior proficiency, with Assertions leading students with low prior proficiency to generate shorter (more efficient) posttest solutions faster. We also present a clustering analysis that shows patterns of productive persistence among students with low prior knowledge when the tutor provides unsolicited help in the form of Assertions. Overall, this work provides encouraging evidence that hint presentation can significantly impact how students use them and using Assertions can be an effective way to address help avoidance.",2021,03//,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education (Springer Science & Business Media B.V.),education,edu_ai,31,1,154-155,,,,#5505,Maniktala 2021,,
Designing Academic Writing Analytics for Civil Law Student Self-Assessment.,"Knight, Simon; Buckingham Shum, Simon; Ryan, Philippa; Sándor, Ágnes; Wang, Xiaolong","Research into the teaching and assessment of student writing shows that many students find academic writing a challenge to learn, with legal writing no exception. Improving the availability and quality of timely formative feedback is an important aim. However, the time-consuming nature of assessing writing makes it impractical for instructors to provide rapid, detailed feedback on hundreds of draft texts which might be improved prior to submission. This paper describes the design of a natural language processing (NLP) tool to provide such support. We report progress in the development of a web application called AWA (Academic Writing Analytics), which has been piloted in a Civil Law degree. We describe: the underlying NLP platform and the participatory design process through which the law academic and analytics team tested and refined an existing rhetorical parser for the discipline; the user interface design and evaluation process; and feedback from students, which was broadly positive, but also identifies important issues to address. We discuss how our approach is positioned in relation to concerns regarding automated essay grading, and ways in which AWA might provide more actionable feedback to students. We conclude by considering how this design process addresses the challenge of making explicit to learners and educators the underlying mode of action in analytic devices such as our rhetorical parser, which we term algorithmic accountability.",2018,03//,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education (Springer Science & Business Media B.V.),education,edu_ai,28,1,1-28,,,,#5502,Knight 2018,,
"Face-to-Face Interaction with Pedagogical Agents, Twenty Years Later.","Johnson, W.; Lester, James","Johnson et al. ( International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 11, 47-78, ) introduced and surveyed a new paradigm for interactive learning environments: animated pedagogical agents. The article argued for combining animated interface agent technologies with intelligent learning environments, yielding intelligent systems that can interact with learners in natural, human-like ways to achieve better learning outcomes. We outlined a variety of possible uses for pedagogical agents. But we offered only preliminary evidence that they improve learning, leaving that to future research and development. Twenty years have elapsed since work began on animated pedagogical agents. This article re-examines the concepts and predictions in the 2000 article in the context of the current state of the field. Some of the ideas in the paper have become well established and widely adopted, especially in game-based learning environments. Others are only now being realized, thanks to advances in immersive interfaces and robotics that enable rich face-to-face interaction between learners and agents. Research has confirmed that pedagogical agents can be beneficial, but not equally for all learning problems, applications, and learner populations.

Why fifth- and seventh-graders submit off-task responses to a web-based reading comprehension tutor rather than expected learning responses.,"Meyer, Bonnie J.F.; Wijekumar, Kausalai Kay","Research shows the students improve their reading comprehension with Intelligent Tutoring of the Structure Strategy (ITSS). One problem for ITSS is that some students are producing responses in the on-line instruction that are unrelated to learning and practicing the reading strategy. These types of disengaged responses can be referred to as system active off-task responses (“off-task”). In this study we characterize who produces off-task responses and why. Classification and Regression Trees (C&RT) and logistic regression analyses were used to answer the why question. Variables predicted to relate to gaming included reading strategy and skill variables, motivation, attitude, self-efficacy, and goal orientation variables, demographic variables, and type of computer feedback (simple versus elaborated). C&RT analysis could explain 66% of the variance in off-task responses. Students without off-task responses were higher in motivation to read and worked in ITSS to produce good main ideas. Students with higher off-task responses had low scores on work mastery goals. The highest producers of off-task responses in Grades 5 and 7 (averaging 24 off-task responses over 7 lessons) had low motivation to read and scored over 2 SD below average on recall tasks in ITSS. The logistic regression could explain 42% of the variance in off-task responses. Use of motivational scales prior to starting instruction as well as on-line performance measures could be used to flag students for early intervention to prevent system active off-task responses and increase on-line learning. The C&RT approach may be particularly helpful to designers in making software more appropriate for different types of students.",2014,06//,Computers & Education,education,edu_computr,75,,229-252,,,,#6457,Meyer 2014,,
Cognitive and affective implications of persuasive technology use on mathematics instruction.,"Ersoy, Mehmet; Akbulut, Yavuz","This study investigated the effects of different computer based interventions on mathematics achievement, attitudes towards search engines and Internet self-efficacy.

The first group resorted to activities provided by a web-based semantic search engine (i.e. Wolfram Alpha). The same content was provided to the second group through a computer algebra system (i.e. Mathematica). The third group followed the same content through linear web pages. The intervention lasted eight weeks. Data were collected through focus-group interviews, an achievement test, an attitude scale on the instructional use of search engines and an Internet self-efficacy scale. The quantitative data were analyzed through descriptive statistics followed by univariate and multivariate analyses of variance whereas the qualitative data were examined through descriptive analysis. MANOVA results revealed that the main effect of testing time, the main effect of intervention, which favored the semantic search engine group, and the interaction effect of intervention by time led to significant differences between students' achievement scores. However, the intervention and interaction effects were not significant for attitude and self-efficacy.

The present study covers m-learning with cellphones only. Auditory design guidelines were developed and revised using an iterative educational design research process. The auditory design guidelines were developed by analyzing previous studies related to m-learning and auditory interface design, and revised using three validation methods. The expert reviews and usability evaluations were conducted as an internal validation method, and a field evaluation was used as an external validation method to confirm the feasibility and educational effects. The results showed that the auditory design guidelines could be applied effectively to the design of audio instructions delivered on smart phones.

Multimodal data to design visual learning analytics for understanding regulation of learning.,"Noroozi, Omid; Alikhani, Iman; Järvelä, Sanna; Kirschner, Paul A.; Juuso, Ilkka; Seppänen, Tapio","The increased interest in multimodal data collection in the learning sciences demands for new and powerful methodological and analytical techniques and technologies. It is especially challenging for learning scientists to handle, analyse, and interpret complex and often invisible multimodal data when investigating regulation of learning in collaborative settings as this data can be cognitive, social and/or emotional in nature, much of which is covert in nature. The aim of this paper is to present ways to simplify the analysis and use of rich multimodal data by learning scientists. This is done by making primarily invisible regulation processes and their accompanying social and contextual reactions visible, measurable, and ultimately interpretable. To facilitate data visualisation and processing with respect to the regulation of learning, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) known as SLAM-KIT has been designed.

Implementation of a Model-Tracing-Based Learning Diagnosis System to Promote Elementary Students' Learning in Mathematics.,Yian-Shu Chu; Haw-Ching Yang; Shian-Shyong Tseng; Che-Ching Yang,"Of all teaching methods, one-to-one human tutoring is the most powerful method for promoting learning. To achieve this aim and reduce teaching load, researchers developed intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) to employ one-to-one tutoring (Aleven, McLaren, & Sewall, 2009; Aleven, McLaren, Sewall, & Koedinger, 2009; Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, & Pelletier, 1995; Anderson & Reiser, 1985; Blessing, Gilbert, Ourada, & Ritter, 2009; Mitrovic et al., 2009; Mitrovic & Ohlsson, 1999; Suraweera, Mitrovic, & Martin, 2007; VanLehn et al., 2005). However, most ITSs have restricted user interfaces, which confine reasoning strategies of students during problem solving, thus ignoring the fact that students could use dissimilar strategies to solve a given question. Furthermore, student learning problems could be diagnosed from the derivation of their answers. In order to interpret students' mathematical problem-solving behaviors, this study developed a Model-tracing Intelligent Tutor (MIT) to diagnose students' learning problems and provide learning feedback for individual students. A quasi-experiment was conducted in an elementary school to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in which 124 fifth graders participated. The experimental results show that the model-tracing-based learning diagnosis system is significantly more helpful to the students in learning mathematics than the conventional web-based test in terms of learning achievements.

Teaching Database Design with Constraint-Based Tutors.,"Mitrovic, Antonija; Suraweera, Pramuditha","Design tasks are difficult to teach, due to large, unstructured solution spaces, underspecified problems, non-existent problem solving algorithms and stopping criteria. In this paper, we comment on our approach to develop KERMIT, a constraint-based tutor that taught database design. In later work, we re-implemented KERMIT as EER-Tutor, and extended its instructional domain. Several evaluation studies performed with KERMIT and EER-Tutor show that they are effective Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). We also comment on various extensions made to EER-Tutor over the years. There are several contributions of our research, such as developing effective problem-solving support for conceptual database design in terms of interface design. Our database design tutors deal with large solution spaces efficiently by specifying constraints that capture equivalent solution states, and using ideal solutions to capture the semantics of the problem. Instead of requiring a problem solver, the ITS checks whether the student's database schema is correct by matching it to constraints and the ideal solution. Another contribution of our work is in guidelines for developing effective feedback to the student.

The objectives of this study were: 1) to document equity patterns in student participation and how they vary based on group composition by race and gender; and 2) to understand how discourses of race and gender influence group interactions. We used the EQUIP web app () to analyze quantitative patterns in student participation. We then identified video of three group sessions and analyzed how discourses of race and gender mediated classroom interactions. Data show that racial hierarchies were prominent, with White students dominating group interaction and Black and Latinx students experiencing substantial marginalization. While there was evidence of gender equity in many groups – particularly those with greater proportions of girls – we show how computing and physics were still maintained as masculine spaces. Teachers of computing should intentionally structure learning environments to attenuate the impact of White supremacy and patriarchy. More research is also needed on how power operates in computing education at the level of classroom interaction.",2020,09//,Computer Science Education,education,edu_computr,30,3,254-278,,,,#5786,Shah 2020,,
Design considerations for combining augmented reality with intelligent tutors.,"Herbert, Bradley; Ens, Barrett; Weerasinghe, Amali; Billinghurst, Mark; Wigley, Grant","Highlights • The effectiveness of Intelligent Tutoring Systems in psychomotor domains can potentially be enhanced by combining them with Augmented Reality paradigms. • Due to ITS complexity and design, work on the use of ITSs with AR is significantly limited and how these paradigms work together is not well understood. • Existing work shows that combining ITSs with AR enhances significantly enhances performance and learning. • Combining AR with ITS requires a gateway interface and networking capabilities in both the ITS and the AR application, due to non-standardised mechanisms used in these systems. • Additional research on the design of the interface; authoring systems for ITSs in AR and their learning effectiveness is required. Graphical abstract Abstract Augmented Reality overlays virtual objects on the real world in real-time and has the potential to enhance education, however, few AR training systems provide personalised learning support. Combining AR with intelligent tutoring systems has the potential to improve training outcomes by providing personalised learner support, such as feedback on the AR environment. This paper reviews the current state of AR training systems combined with ITSs and proposes a series of requirements for combining the two paradigms. In addition, this paper identifies a growing need to provide more research in the context of design and implementation of adaptive augmented reality tutors (ARATs). These include possibilities of evaluating the user interfaces of ARAT and potential domains where an ARAT might be considered effective.",2018,12//,Computers & Graphics,technology,tech_computr_graph,77,,166-182,,,,#4945,Herbert 2018,,
Effects of interactivity and instructional scaffolding on learning: Self-regulation in online video-based environments.,"Delen, Erhan; Liew, Jeffrey; Willson, Victor","Online learning often requires learners to be self-directed and engaged. The present study examined students' self-regulatory behaviors in online video-based learning environments. Using an experimental design, this study investigated the effects of a newly designed enhanced video learning environment, which was designed to support or scaffold students' self-regulated or self-directed learning on students' learning behaviors and outcomes. In addition, correspondence between students' self-regulation strategies in traditional learning environments and observed self-regulated learning behaviors in the enhanced video environment were examined. A cross-sectional experimental research design with systematic random assignment of participants to either the control condition (common video) or the experimental condition (enhanced video) was utilized. Undergraduate and graduate students participated in the study (N = 80). Study results indicate that the newly designed enhanced video learning environment was a superior instructional tool than the common video learning environment in terms students' learning performance. In addition, there was correspondence between graduate students' self-reported self-regulation and observed self-regulation, with those high on seeking/learning information and managing their environment/behavior more likely to engage more in interactive note-taking.",2014,09//,Computers & Education,education,edu_computr,78,,312-320,,,,#6435,Delen 2014,,
The Negotiation of Meaning in Epistemic Situations.,"Baker, Michael","This article is a commentary on a model for negotiation in teaching-learning dialogues (Baker ) that traces its origins and developments over the past 20 years. The first main section of the paper describes the research background out of which the model arose, within the credo of individualised tutoring of the 1980s. This is followed by a summary of the main elements of the model, then a presentation of its subsequent developments. These comprise the analysis of argumentation dialogue and its potential for collaborative learning, the analysis of interpersonal relations in relation to the interactive regulation of affect, and extensions of the model to other epistemic situations such as explanation generation, co-design, online epistemic discussions and use of communication interfaces in computer-supported collaborative learning environments. On these bases, the object of study of this research is defined as the processes of negotiation of meaning in epistemic situations. It is concluded that the main core of the model was retained, throughout its deepening and extension, but the underlying theory was radically changed, from cognitivist belief-systems to a view of dialogue itself as collective thinking. Two challenges for artificial intelligence and education research are raised: the formalisation of interpersonal relations as they are played out in social interaction, and the analysis of the processes of appropriation of discourse genres.

A New Perspective of Negotiation-Based Dialog to Enhance Metacognitive Skills in the Context of Open Learner Models.,"Suleman, Raja; Mizoguchi, Riichiro; Ikeda, Mitsuru","Negotiation mechanism using conversational agents (chatbots) has been used in Open Learner Models (OLM) to enhance learner model accuracy and provide opportunities for learner reflection. Using chatbots that allow for natural language discussions has shown positive learning gains in students. Traditional OLMs assume a learner to be able to manage their own learning and already in an appropriate affective/behavioral state that is conducive for learning. This paper proposes a new perspective of learning that advances the state of the art in fully-negotiated OLMs by exploiting learner's affective & behavioral states to generate engaging natural language dialogues that train them to enhance their metacognitive skills. In order to achieve this, we have developed the NDLtutor that provides a natural language interface to learners. Our system generates context-aware dialogues automatically to enhance learner participation and reflection. This paper provides details on the design and implementation of the NDLtutor and discusses two evaluation studies. The first evaluation study focuses on the dialogue management capabilities of our system and demonstrates that our dialog system works satisfactorily to realize meaningful and natural interactions for negotiation. The second evaluation study investigates the effects of our system on the self-assessment and self-reflection of the learners. The results of the evaluations show that the NDLtutor is able to produce significant improvements in the self-assessment accuracy of the learners and also provides adequate support for prompting self-reflection in learners.",2016,12//,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education (Springer Science & Business Media B.V.),education,edu_ai,26,4,1069-1115,,,,#5925,Suleman 2016,,
Understanding the effects of real-time sentiment analysis and morale visualisation in backchannel systems: A case study.,"Wyeld, Theodor; Jiranantanagorn, Peerumporn; Shen, Haifeng; Liao, Kewen; Bednarz, Tomasz","• Design and evaluation of a backchannel system for connecting presenters with audience in realtime. After reviewing existing systems, the best components were included and new components added to improve overall performance and usability. • Using a seven part principles-based evaluation system, analysis of the effectives of the tool possible as well as user attitude towards use of the tool. This was also analysed and confirms the tools effectiveness. • A Markov chain was computed to confirm initial findings as well as predict possible future uptake of the tool. • Some recommendations about future research directions and applicability of this tool in a wider context – other than education alone – is discussed. When presenting to a large group of students, either in an amphitheatre or through an online platform, effectively connecting to the audience – understanding how well the audience is following the presentation and taking appropriate actions promptly if they experience difficulties – is a serious challenge. Backchannel systems are sometimes deployed to address this issue by allowing audience to give feedback to the presenter without interrupting the current discourse. However, these systems are not designed to immediately aggregate and present the audience's feedback to the presenter in a meaningful way that is easy to quickly digest. To fill this gap, we have explored a proof-of-concept method for analysing the emotions and sentiments from the audience's feedback in real time and displaying to the presenter a morale graph showing a trend of the audience's overall reaction over time. This allows a presenter to effectively connected to their audience in real time, knowing whether their presentation is going well and what issues their audience may have in common at any specific moment. We have further implemented this method in an educational context, using a prototype backchannel system, known as ClasSense , for a lecturer to effectively connect to their students. This paper presents the evaluation of this system, which shows that lecturers accept and prefer the morale graph based user interface developed over other backchannel user interfaces that display all posts in chronological order. Students also positively expressed their agreement that the system not only makes their feedback an important part of the class but also increases their interactions with the lecturers. This is further confirmed with a Markov chain predicting the probability that students' and lecturers' survey results lead to their overall positive sentiment towards the tool. The flexibility of the ClasSense system suggests it may also be suitable in contexts other than education.",2021,01//,International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,engineering,eng_hci,145,,N.PAG-N.PAG,,,,#5878,Wyeld 2021,,
Intelligent Computer Assisted Language Learning (ICALL) for nêhiyawêwin: An In-Depth User-Experience Evaluation.,"Bontogon, Megan; Arppe, Antti; Antonsen, Lene; Thunder, Dorothy; Lachler, Jordan","Intelligent computer assisted language learning (ICALL) applications for Indigenous languages are a relatively new avenue for computer assisted language learning (CALL). CALL allows language learners to practise a wide range of grammatical exercises and receive feedback on their answers outside of class time. ICALL is essential for dynamically producing these exercises for polysynthetic Indigenous languages with complex morphology. To better understand user perceptions and behaviours within an ICALL setting, an in-depth user evaluation of nêhiyawêtân (a university-level ICALL application for Plains Cree) was initiated. Five second language learners of Plains Cree were recorded using nêhiyawêtân as they completed various grammatical exercises. They were encouraged to report their opinions, thoughts, and observations aloud. Subsequently, observed user reactions and strategies were recorded. This supplied us with potential user errors, strategies, and preferences that allowed us to improve answer feedback and the design and interface of the exercise templates. Moreover, the results of surveys and observations highlighted sociocultural issues that are not seen in mainstream CALL for majority languages. We hope that this evaluation will serve as a guideline for evaluating future ICALL programs for Indigenous and other minority languages.

An adaptation algorithm for an intelligent natural language tutoring system.,"Latham, Annabel; Crockett, Keeley; McLean, David","The focus of computerised learning has shifted from content delivery towards personalised online learning with Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Oscar Conversational ITS (CITS) is a sophisticated ITS that uses a natural language interface to enable learners to construct their own knowledge through discussion. Oscar CITS aims to mimic a human tutor by dynamically detecting and adapting to an individual's learning styles whilst directing the conversational tutorial. Oscar CITS is currently live and being successfully used to support learning by university students. The major contribution of this paper is the development of the novel Oscar CITS adaptation algorithm and its application to the Felder–Silverman learning styles model. The generic Oscar CITS adaptation algorithm uniquely combines the strength of an individual's learning style preference with the available adaptive tutoring material for each tutorial question to decide the best fitting adaptation. A case study is described, where Oscar CITS is implemented to deliver an adaptive SQL tutorial. Two experiments are reported which empirically test the Oscar CITS adaptation algorithm with students in a real teaching/learning environment. The results show that learners experiencing a conversational tutorial personalised to their learning styles performed significantly better during the tutorial than those with an unmatched tutorial.",2014,02//,Computers & Education,education,edu_computr,71,,97-110,,,,#5873,Latham 2014,,
Optimization of self-learning in Computer Engineering courses: An intelligent software system supported by Artificial Neural Network and Vortex Optimization Algorithm.,"Kose, Utku; Arslan, Ahmet","ABSTRACT Self-learning process is an important factor that enables learners to improve their own educational experiences when they are away of face-to-face interactions with the teacher. A well-designed self-learning activity process supports both learners and teachers to achieve educational objectives rapidly. Because of this, there has always been a remarkable trend on developing alternative self-learning approaches. In this context, this study is based on two essential objectives. Firstly, it aims to introduce an intelligent software system, which optimizes and improves computer engineering students' self-learning processes. Secondly, it aims to improve computer engineering students' self-learning during the courses. As general, the software system introduced here evaluates students' intelligence levels according to the Theory of Multiple Intelligences and supports their learning via accurately chosen materials provided over the software interface. The evaluation mechanism of the system is based on a hybrid Artificial Intelligence approach formed by an Artificial Neural Network, and an optimization algorithm called as Vortex Optimization Algorithm (VOA). The system is usable for especially technical courses taught at computer engineering departments of universities and makes it easier to teach abstract subjects. For having idea about success of the system, it has been tested with students and positive results on optimizing and improving self-learning have been obtained. Additionally, also a technical evaluation has been done previously, in order to see if the VOA is a good choice to be used in the system. It can be said that the whole obtained results encourage the authors to continue to future works.

Learning from multi-label data with interactivity constraints: An extensive experimental study.,"Nair-Benrekia, Noureddine-Yassine; Kuntz, Pascale; Meyer, Frank","Interactive classification aims at introducing user preferences in the learning process to produce individualized outcomes more adapted to each user’s behavior than the fully automatic approaches. The current interactive classification systems generally adopt a single-label classification paradigm that constrains items to span one label at a time and consequently limit the user’s expressiveness while he/she interacts with data that are inherently multi-label. Moreover, the experimental evaluations are mainly subjective and closely depend on the targeted use cases and the interface characteristics. This paper presents the first extensive study of the impact of the interactivity constraints on the performances of a large set of twelve well-established multi-label learning methods. We restrict ourselves to the evaluation of the classifier predictive and time-computation performances while the number of training examples regularly increases and we focus on the beginning of the classification task where few examples are available. The classifier performances are evaluated with an experimental protocol independent of any implementation environment on a set of twelve multi-label benchmarks of various sizes from different domains. Our comparison shows that four classifiers can be distinguished for the prediction quality: RF-PCT (Random Forest of Predictive Clustering Trees, (Kocev, 2011)), EBR (Ensemble of Binary Relevance, (Read et al., 2011)), CLR (Calibrated Label Ranking, (Fürnkranz et al., 2008)) and ML k NN (Multi-label k NN, (Zhang and Zhou, 2007)) with an advantage for the first two ensemble classifiers. Moreover, only RF-PCT competes with the fastest classifiers and is therefore considered as the most promising classifier for an interactive multi-label learning system.",2015,08//,Expert Systems with Applications,technology,tech_is,42,13,5723-5736,,,,#5755,Nair-Benrekia 2015,,
Mechanix: A natural sketch interface tool for teaching truss analysis and free-body diagrams.,"Hammond, Tracy; Linsey, Julie; Atilola, Olufunmilola; Valentine, Stephanie; Kim, Hong-Hoe; Turner, David; McTigue, Erin","Massive open online courses, online tutoring systems, and other computer homework systems are rapidly changing engineering education by providing increased student feedback and capitalizing upon online systems' scalability. While online homework systems provide great benefits, a growing concern among engineering educators is that students are losing both the critical art of sketching and the ability to take a real system and reduce it to an accurate but simplified free-body diagram (FBD). For example, some online systems allow the drag and drop of forces onto FBDs, but they do not allow the user to sketch the FBDs, which is a vital part of the learning process. In this paper, we discuss Mechanix, a sketch recognition tool that provides an efficient means for engineering students to learn how to draw truss FBDs and solve truss problems. The system allows students to sketch FBDs into a tablet computer or by using a mouse and a standard computer monitor. Using artificial intelligence, Mechanix can determine not only the component shapes and features of the diagram but also the relationships between those shapes and features. Because Mechanix is domain specific, it can use those relationships to determine not only whether a student's work is correct but also why it is incorrect. Mechanix is then able to provide immediate, constructive feedback to students without providing final answers. Within this manuscript, we document the inner workings of Mechanix, including the artificial intelligence behind the scenes, and present studies of the effects on student learning. The evaluations have shown that Mechanix is as effective as paper-and-pencil-based homework for teaching method of joints truss analysis; focus groups with students who used the program have revealed that they believe Mechanix enhances their learning and that they are highly engaged while using it.",2014,05//,AI EDAM,ai,ai,28,2,169-192,,,,#5779,Hammond 2014,,
Effects of Prior Knowledge in Mathematics on Learner-Interface Interactions in a Learning-by-Teaching Intelligent Tutoring System.,"Bringula, Rex P.; Basa, Roselle S.; Dela Cruz, Cecilio; Rodrigo, Ma. Mercedes T.","This study attempted to determine the influence of prior knowledge in mathematics of students on learner-interface interactions in a learning-by-teaching intelligent tutoring system. One hundred thirty-nine high school students answered a pretest (i.e., the prior knowledge in mathematics) and a posttest. In between the pretest and posttest, they used the SimStudent, an intelligent tutoring system that follows a teaching-by-learning paradigm. The intervention period lasted for three consecutive days with 1 hour session each. SimStudent captured learner-interface interactions, such as time spent tutoring, number of quizzes conducted, and number of hints requested. It was disclosed that prior knowledge in term identification was the only skill that had a consistent, positive, and significant influence on learner-interface interaction with a SimStudent. Thus, the null hypothesis stating that prior knowledge in mathematics does not significantly influence interaction of students with a simulated student was partially rejected. It was concluded that the students may demonstrate or omit a skill, depending on their prior knowledge on identifying the terms of equations and the next step in solving equations.

HOW TO PROGRAM A CHATBOT -- AN INTRODUCTORY PROJECT AND STUDENT PERCEPTIONS.,"Ju Long; Yuan, Michael Juntao; Hsun-Ming Lee","Aim/Purpose One of the most fascinating developments in computer user interfaces in recent years is the rise of ""chatbots"". Yet extent information system (IS) curriculum lacks teaching resources on chatbots programming. Background To better prepare students for this new technological development and to enhance the IS curriculum, we introduce a project that teaches students how to program simple chatbots, including a transactional chatbot and a conversational chatbot. Methodology We demonstrated a project that teaches students how to program two types of simple chatbots: a transactional chatbot and a conversational chatbot. We also conducted a survey to examine students' perceptions on their learning experience. Findings Our survey on students' perception of the project finds that learning chatbots is deemed very useful because chatbot programming projects have enabled the students to understand the subject better. We also found that social influence has positively motivated the students to learn chatbot programming. Though most of the students have no prior experiences programming chatbots, their self-efficacy towards chatbot programming remained high after working through the programming project. Despite the difficult tasks, over 71% of respondents agree to various degrees that chatbot programming is fun. Though most students agree that chatbot programming is not easy to learn, more than 70% of respondents indicated that they will use or learn chatbots in the near future. The overwhelmingly positive responses are impressive given that this is the first time for the students to program and learn chatbots. Recommendations for Practitioners In this article, we introduced a step by step project on teaching chatbot programming in an information systems class. Following the project instructions, students can get their first intelligent chatbots up and running in a few hours using Slack. This article describes the project in detail as well as students' perceptions. Recommendations for Researchers We used UTAUT model to measure students' perception of the projects. This study could be of value to researchers studying students' technology learning and adoption behaviors. Impact on Society To our best knowledge, pedagogical resources that teach IS students how to program chatbots, especially the introductory level materials, are limited. We hope this teaching case could be of value for IS educators when introducing IS students to the wonderful field of chatbot programming.

The findings support that students can benefit from the application of the online laboratory. Background: Control system design is vital in control engineering education. Conventionally, lectures on control system design are difficult for students to comprehend. Some online laboratories can be used for remote and virtual experiments on control system design. However, little attention has been paid to the possible classroom demonstration using online laboratories. Intended Outcomes: Students in a course on control system design are expected to be able to: 1) comprehend theories and concepts better from improved classroom teaching with online interactive demonstrations; 2) customize control algorithms in after-class experimentation; and 3) tailor monitoring interfaces with rich interactive features. Application Design: Education-oriented technologies are provided to offer both remote and virtual experimental services. 3-D visualization and interaction are achieved which enable great flexibility and interactivities for users. The proportional–integral (PI) control of a remote fan speed control test rig has been used to teach the design of integral anti-windup. Teaching and learning scenarios have been demonstrated regarding students at four different levels, which can help students to comprehend different concepts in control related modules. Findings: The multiyear evaluation results show that there is an improvement in student performance with the application of Networked Control System Laboratory (NCSLab). Students obtained a higher final score in the two class modules on average.

Knowledge discovery of game design features by mining user-generated feedback.,"Gopinath Bharathi, Ajay Karthic B.; Singh, Abhinav; Tucker, Conrad S.; Nembhard, Harriet B.","The term “Gamification” is an emerging paradigm that aims to employ game mechanics and game thinking to change behavior. Gamification offers several effective ways to motivate users into action such as challenges, levels and rewards. However, an open research problem is discovering the set of gamification features that consistently result in a higher probability of success for a given task, game or application. The objective of this paper is to bridge this knowledge gap by quantifying the gamification features that are consistently found in successful applications. Knowledge gained from this work will inform designers about the gamification features that lead to higher chances of an application's success, and the gamification features that do not significantly impact the success of an application. The case study presented in this work leverages demographic heterogeneity and scale of applications existing within mobile platforms to evaluate the impact of gamification features on the success or failure of those applications. The successful game design features identified have the potential to be embedded into interactive gamification platforms across various fields such as healthcare, education, military and marketing, in order to maintain or enhance user engagement.

How Should Intelligent Tutoring Systems Sequence Multiple Graphical Representations of Fractions? A Multi-Methods Study.,"Rau, M.; Aleven, V.; Rummel, N.; Pardos, Z.","Providing learners with multiple representations of learning content has been shown to enhance learning outcomes. When multiple representations are presented across consecutive problems, we have to decide in what sequence to present them. Prior research has demonstrated that interleaving tasks types (as opposed to blocking them) can foster learning. Do the same advantages apply to interleaving representations? We addressed this question using a variety of research methods. First, we conducted a classroom experiment with an intelligent tutoring system for fractions. We compared four practice schedules of multiple graphical representations: blocked, fully interleaved, moderately interleaved, and increasingly interleaved. Based on data from 230 4th and 5th-grade students, we found that interleaved practice leads to better learning outcomes than blocked practice on a number of measures. Second, we conducted a think-aloud study to gain insights into the learning mechanisms underlying the advantage of interleaved practice. Results show that students make connections between representations only when explicitly prompted to do so (and not spontaneously). This finding suggests that reactivation, rather than abstraction, is the main mechanism to account for the advantage of interleaved practice. Third, we used methods derived from Bayesian knowledge tracing to analyze tutor log data from the classroom experiment. Modeling latent measures of students' learning rates, we find higher learning rates for interleaved practice than for blocked practice. This finding extends prior research on practice schedules, which shows that interleaved practice (compared to blocked practice) impairs students' problem-solving performance during the practice phase when using raw performance measures such as error rates. Our findings have implications for the design of multi-representational learning materials and for research on adaptive practice schedules in intelligent tutoring systems.",2014,06//,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education (Springer Science & Business Media B.V.),education,edu_ai,24,2,125-161,,,,#5417,Rau 2014,,

Autoethnographic interaction with a paradigmatic platform is used to show a variety of inscriptions and translations. The classifications, standardizations and quantitative calculations that emerge here are analyzed as practices for generating data, which in turn stabilize the platform as a specific ontological configuration. The data give the impression of being personal. On closer examination, however, they are the product of manifold relations between different actors in the network.

Foundations of Multimodal Co-learning.,"Zadeh, Amir; Liang, Paul Pu; Morency, Louis-Philippe","• Introduction and studies of Multimodal Co-learning (MCl). • MCl is better for unimodal downstream than unimodal learning. • MCl entails modalities learn mapping to each other. • This claim is substantially backed by empirical evidence. • MCl is an entropy lower-bound to unimodal learning. In the current state of the field of machine learning, often, real-world phenomena are learned through studies of isolated modalities; such as modeling language exclusively from verbal modality, which is a common theme in natural language processing. This is widely adopted since downstream tasksin different disciplines of machine learning are also often similarly isolated and unimodal. In sharp contrast to this, human learning from real-world experiences is rarely unimodal, and often exhibits a multisensory nature, regardless of any assumptions about downstream tasks. The cognitive constructs in human brain are consistently developed through multisensory reinforcement, and the same constructs generalize to unimodal scenarios. The difference between the trend of unimodal learning and human cognitive development raises the following question: ""Even if downstream tasks are unimodal during test time, is it better to learn from the isolated modality or from multimodal information?"". In this paper we focus on an in-depth study of this research question. We study the differences between unimodal learning and Multimodal Co-learning (MCl), both from empirical and theoretical standpoints. Through the lens of information entropy and characteristics of deep neural networks, we demonstrate strong theoretical justifications in favor of MCl.

Design and evaluation of a parallel algorithm for inferring topic hierarchies.,"Seshadri, Karthick; Mercy Shalinie, S; Kollengode, Chidambaram","The rapid growth of information in the digital world especially on the web, calls for automated methods of organizing the digital information for convenient access and efficient information retrieval. Topic modeling is a branch of machine learning and probabilistic graphical modeling that helps in arranging the web pages according to their topical structure. The topic distribution over a set of documents (web pages) and the affinity of a document toward a specific topic can be revealed using topic modeling. Topic modeling algorithms are typically computationally expensive due to their iterative nature. Recent research efforts have attempted to parallelize specific topic models and are successful in their attempts. These parallel algorithms however have tightly-coupled parallel processes which require frequent synchronization and are also tightly coupled with the underlying topic model which is used for inferring the topic hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a parallel algorithm to infer topic hierarchies from a large scale document corpus. A key feature of the proposed algorithm is that it exploits coarse grained parallelism and the components running in parallel need not synchronize after every iteration, thus the algorithm lends itself to be implemented on a geographically dispersed set of processing elements interconnected through a network. The parallel algorithm realizes a speed up of 53.5 on a 32-node cluster of dual-core workstations and at the same time achieving approximately the same likelihood or predictive accuracy as that of the sequential algorithm, with respect to the performance of Information Retrieval tasks.

The issue encompasses three primary themes critical to understanding formative feedback: 1) the role of human information processing and individual learner characteristics for feedback efficiency, 2) how to deliver meaningful feedback to learners in domains of study where student work is difficult to assess, and 3) how human feedback sources (e.g., peer students) can be supported by user interfaces and technology-generated feedback.

Predicting interaction design patterns for designing explicit interactions in ambient intelligence systems: a case study.,"Silva-Rodríguez, Viridiana; Nava-Muñoz, Sandra E.; Castro, Luis A.; Martínez-Pérez, Francisco E.; Pérez-González, Héctor G.; Torres-Reyes, Francisco","Ambient intelligence (AmI) focuses on supporting people by designing sensitive and responsive environments to context through implicit and explicit interactions. Explicit interactions in AmI systems have requirements specific to making interactions robust, smooth, intuitive, and reliable. Based on requirements, the designers can detect and eliminate faults from the beginning of the design process and understand the users’ needs and demands. This work presents a UIPatternM model for predicting interaction design patterns from processing text-based requirements through machine learning algorithms. We evaluate the predictions of our proposal. We also present a case study with professional designers who evaluated the UIPatternM recommender predictions according to a set of design-level requirements that emulate everyday needs. Our participants performed a set of tasks based on scenarios, and we evaluated the participants’ using effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction as performance metrics. Applying the UIPatternM model helped to endorse the conception and refinement of user interface design for explicit interaction in AmI systems.

Toward a visual approach in the exploration of shape grammars.,"STROBBE, TIEMEN; PAUWELS, PIETER; VERSTRAETEN, RUBEN; DE MEYER, RONALD; VAN CAMPENHOUT, JAN","The concept of shape grammars has often been proposed to improve or support creative design processes. Shape grammar implementations have the potential to both automate parts of the design process and allow exploration of design alternatives. In many of the existing implementations, the main focus is either on capturing the rationale of a particular existing grammar or on allowing designers to develop a new grammar. However, little attention is typically given to the actual representation of the design space that can be explored in the interface of the implementation.With such representation, a shape grammar implementation could properly support designers who are still in the process of designing and may not yet have a clear shape grammar in mind. In this article, an approach and a proof-of-concept software system is proposed for a shape grammar implementation that provides a visual and interactive way to support design space exploration in a creative design process.We describe the method by which this software system can be used and focus on how designers can interact with the exploration process. In particular, we point out how the proposed approach realizes several important amplification strategies to support design space exploration.",2015,11//,AI EDAM,ai,ai,29,4,503-521,,,,#5414,STROBBE 2015,,
Development of flexible languages for scenario and team description in multirobot missions.,"Castro Silva, Daniel; Henriques Abreu, Pedro; Reis, Luís Paulo; Oliveira, Eugénio","The work described in this paper is part of the development of a framework to support the joint execution of cooperative missions by a group of vehicles, in a simulated, augmented, or real environment. Such a framework brings forward the need for formal languages in which to specify the vehicles that compose a team, the scenario in which they will operate, and the mission to be performed. This paper introduces the Scenario Description Language (SDL) and the Team Description Language (TDL), two Extensible Markup Language based dialects that compose the static components necessary for representing scenario and mission knowledge. SDL provides a specification of physical scenario and global operational constraints, while TDL defines the team of vehicles, as well as team-specific operational restrictions. The dialects were defined using Extensible Markup Language schemas, with all required information being integrated in the definitions. An interface was developed and incorporated into the framework, allowing for the creation and edition of SDL and TDL files. Once the information is specified, it can be used in the framework, thus facilitating environment and team specification and deployment. A survey answered by practitioners and researchers shows that the satisfaction with SDL+TDL is elevated (the overall evaluation of SDL+TDL achieved a score of 4 out of 5, with 81%/78.6% of the answers ≥4); in addition, the usability of the interface was evaluated, achieving a score of 86.7 in the System Usability Scale survey. These results imply that SDL+TDL is flexible enough to represent scenarios and teams, through a user-friendly interface. ",2017,02//,AI EDAM,ai,ai,31,1,69-86,,,,#5410,CastroSilva 2017,,

Supporting Effective Collaboration: Using a Rearview Mirror to Look Forward.,"McManus, Margaret; Aiken, Robert","Our original research, to design and develop an Intelligent Collaborative Learning System (ICLS), yielded the creation of a Group Leader Tutor software system which utilizes a Collaborative Skills Network to monitor students working collaboratively in a networked environment. The Collaborative Skills Network was a conceptualization of collaborative skills and subskills associated with particular sentence openers. The Group Leader (GL) Tutor taught students effective use of collaboration skills while they worked in Jigsaw Teams on a Local Area Network (LAN). In their discussions, students selected sentence openers associated with particular collaborative skills defined in the Collaborative Skills Network, completing them with free-form sentence closers. Subsequent researchers leveraged this system in various ways including incorporating intelligent agents, expanding the Collaborative Skills Network, and matching sentence openers with appropriate sentence closers. The universal use of the Internet, responsive user interfaces, and learning management systems (LMS) have since provided additional research opportunities using more powerful technology. The ICLS research continues to hold promise for future applications and extensions of our model to new domains. Addressing the needs of both traditional students as well as adult learners in e-learning environments, even MOOCs, may extend the reach of our research into the future.

Emerging Complexity in Distributed Intelligent Systems.,"Guleva, Valentina; Shikov, Egor; Bochenina, Klavdiya; Kovalchuk, Sergey; Alodjants, Alexander; Boukhanovsky, Alexander","Distributed intelligent systems (DIS) appear where natural intelligence agents (humans) and artificial intelligence agents (algorithms) interact, exchanging data and decisions and learning how to evolve toward a better quality of solutions. The networked dynamics of distributed natural and artificial intelligence agents leads to emerging complexity different from the ones observed before. In this study, we review and systematize different approaches in the distributed intelligence field, including the quantum domain. A definition and mathematical model of DIS (as a new class of systems) and its components, including a general model of DIS dynamics, are introduced. In particular, the suggested new model of DIS contains both natural (humans) and artificial (computer programs, chatbots, etc.) intelligence agents, which take into account their interactions and communications. We present the case study of domain-oriented DIS based on different agents' classes and show that DIS dynamics shows complexity effects observed in other well-studied complex systems. We examine our model by means of the platform of personal self-adaptive educational assistants (avatars), especially designed in our University. Avatars interact with each other and with their owners. Our experiment allows finding an answer to the vital question: How quickly will DIS adapt to owners' preferences so that they are satisfied? We introduce and examine in detail learning time as a function of network topology. We have shown that DIS has an intrinsic source of complexity that needs to be addressed while developing predictable and trustworthy systems of natural and artificial intelligence agents. Remarkably, our research and findings promoted the improvement of the educational process at our university in the presence of COVID-19 pandemic conditions.",2020,12//,Entropy,science,sci_entrop,22,12,1437,,,,#5457,Guleva 2020,,
An Advanced eLearning Environment Developed for Engineering Learners.,"Samarakou, Maria; Fylladitakis, Emmanouil D.; Früh, Wolf-Gerrit; Hatziapostolou, Antonios; Gelegenis, John J.","-Monitoring and evaluating engineering learners through computer-based laboratory exercises is a difficult task, especially under classroom conditions. A complete diagnosis requires the capability to assess both the competence of the learner to use the scientific software and the understanding of the theoretical principles.

Performance and usability of machine learning for screening in systematic reviews: a comparative evaluation of three tools.,"Gates, Allison; Guitard, Samantha; Pillay, Jennifer; Elliott, Sarah A.; Dyson, Michele P.; Newton, Amanda S.; Hartling, Lisa","Background: We explored the performance of three machine learning tools designed to facilitate title and abstract screening in systematic reviews (SRs) when used to (a) eliminate irrelevant records (automated simulation) and (b) complement the work of a single reviewer (semi-automated simulation). We evaluated user experiences for each tool. Methods: We subjected three SRs to two retrospective screening simulations. In each tool (Abstrackr, DistillerSR, RobotAnalyst), we screened a 200-record training set and downloaded the predicted relevance of the remaining records. We calculated the proportion missed and workload and time savings compared to dual independent screening. To test user experiences, eight research staff tried each tool and completed a survey. Results: Using Abstrackr, DistillerSR, and RobotAnalyst, respectively, the median (range) proportion missed was 5 (0 to 28) percent, 97 (96 to 100) percent, and 70 (23 to 100) percent for the automated simulation and 1 (0 to 2) percent, 2 (0 to 7) percent, and 2 (0 to 4) percent for the semi-automated simulation. The median (range) workload savings was 90 (82 to 93) percent, 99 (98 to 99) percent, and 85 (85 to 88) percent for the automated simulation and 40 (32 to 43) percent, 49 (48 to 49) percent, and 35 (34 to 38) percent for the semi-automated simulation. The median (range) time savings was 154 (91 to 183), 185 (95 to 201), and 157 (86 to 172) hours for the automated simulation and 61 (42 to 82), 92 (46 to 100), and 64 (37 to 71) hours for the semi-automated simulation. Abstrackr identified 33–90% of records missed by a single reviewer. RobotAnalyst performed less well and DistillerSR provided no relative advantage. User experiences depended on user friendliness, qualities of the user interface, features and functions, trustworthiness, ease and speed of obtaining predictions, and practicality of the export file(s). Conclusions: The workload savings afforded in the automated simulation came with increased risk of missing relevant records. Supplementing a single reviewer's decisions with relevance predictions (semi-automated simulation) sometimes reduced the proportion missed, but performance varied by tool and SR. Designing tools based on reviewers' self-identified preferences may improve their compatibility with present workflows.

"From data to personal user models for life‐long, life‐wide learners.","Kay, Judy; Kummerfeld, Bob","As technology has become ubiquitous in learning contexts, there has been an explosion in the amount of learning data. This creates opportunities to draw on the decades of learner modelling research from Artificial Intelligence in Education and more recent research on Personal Informatics. We use these bodies of research to introduce a conceptual model for a Personal User Model for Life‐long, Life‐wide Learners (PUMLs). We use this to define a core set of system competency questions. A successful PUML and its interface must enable a learner to answer these by scrutinising their PUML, aided by its scaffolding interfaces. We aim to give learners both control over their own learning data and the means to harness that data for the important metacognitive processes of self‐monitoring, reflection and planning. We conclude with a set of design guidelines for creating PUMLs. Our core contribution is a way to think about the design and evaluation of learning data and applications so that they give learner control and agency beyond simple data access and algorithmic transparency.

Authoring Effective Embedded Tutors: An Overview of the Extensible Problem Specific Tutor (xPST) System.,"Gilbert, Stephen; Blessing, Stephen; Guo, Enruo","The Extensible Problem Specific Tutor (xPST) allows authors who are not cognitive scientists and not programmers to quickly create an intelligent tutoring system that provides instruction akin to a model-tracing tutor. Furthermore, this instruction is overlaid on existing software, so that the learner's interface does not have to be made from scratch. The xPST architecture allows for extending its capabilities by the addition of plug-ins that communicate with additional third-party software. After reviewing this general architecture, we describe three major implementations that we have created using the xPST system, each using different third-party software as the learner's interface. We have conducted three evaluations of authors using xPST to create tutoring content, and these are considered in turn. These evaluations show that xPST authors can quickly learn the system, and can efficiently produce successful embedded instruction.

When Does Scaffolding Provide Too Much Assistance? A Code-Tracing Tutor Investigation.,"Jennings, Jay; Muldner, Kasia","When students are first learning to program, they not only have to learn to write programs, but also how to trace them. Code tracing involves stepping through a program step-by-step, which helps to predict the output of the program and identify bugs. Students routinely struggle with this activity, as evidenced by prior work and our own experiences in the classroom. To address this, we designed a Code Tracing (CT)-Tutor. We varied the level of assistance provided in the tutor, based on (1) the interface scaffolding available during code tracing, and (2) instructional order, operationalized by when examples were provided, either before or after the corresponding problem was solved. We collected data by having participants use the tutor to solve code tracing problems (N = 97) and analyzed both learning outcomes and process data obtained by extracting features of interest from the log files. We used a multi-layered approach for the analysis, including standard inferential statistics and unsupervised learning to cluster students by their behaviors in the tutor. The results show that the optimal level of assistance for code tracing falls in the middle of the assistance spectrum included in the tutor, but also that there are individual differences in terms of optimal assistance for subgroups of individuals. Based on these results, we outline opportunities for future work around personalizing instruction for code tracing.",2021,12//,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education (Springer Science & Business Media B.V.),education,edu_ai,31,4,784-819,,,,#5308,Jennings 2021,,

In this work, we show the results of teaching patterns using an artificial intelligent assistant that helps novice developers during the design process. Our assistant is an interface agent that observes novice users working, and when it detects that a design pattern can be applied, it makes a suggestion justifying its opinion.

Promoting students' learning achievement and self‐efficacy: A mobile chatbot approach for nursing training.,"Chang, Ching‐Yi; Hwang, Gwo‐Jen; Gau, Meei‐Ling","The aims of nursing training include not only mastering skills but also fostering the competence to make decisions for problem solving. In prenatal education, cultivating nurses' knowledge and competence of vaccine administration is a crucial issue for protecting pregnant women and newborns from infection. Therefore, obstetric vaccination knowledge has become a basic and essential training program for nursing students. However, most of these training programs are given via the lecture‐based teaching approach with skills practice, providing students with few opportunities to think deeply about the relevant issues owing to the lack of interaction and context. This could have a negative impact on their learning effectiveness and clinical judgment. To address this problem, a mobile chatbot‐based learning approach is proposed in this study to enable students to learn and think deeply in the contexts of handling obstetric vaccine cases via interacting with the chatbot. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was implemented. Two classes of 36 students from a university in northern Taiwan were recruited as participants. One class was the experimental group learning with the proposed approach, while the other class was the control group learning with the conventional approach (ie, giving lectures to explain the instructional content and training cases). The results indicate that applying a mobile chatbot for learning can enhance nursing students' learning achievement and self‐efficacy. In addition, based on the analysis of the interview results, students generally believed that learning through the mobile chatbot was able to promote their self‐efficacy as well as their learning engagement and performance.  Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic  Issues relevant to AI technology in education have been extensively discussed and explored around the world. Among the various AI systems, the potential of chatbots has been highlighted by researchers owing to the user‐friendly interface developed using the natural language processing (NLP) technology. Few studies using AI chatbots in professional training have been conducted.  What this paper adds  In this study, a mobile chatbot was used in a nursing training program to enhance students' learning achievement and self‐efficacy for handling vaccine cases. The mobile chatbot significantly improved the students' learning achievement and self‐efficacy in comparison with the conventional learning approach in the vaccine training program. From the interview results, it was found that the students generally believed that the mobile chatbot was able to promote their self‐efficacy as well as learning engagement and performances in the vaccine training program.  Implications for practice and/or policy  Mobile chatbots have great potential for professional training owing to their convenient and user‐friendly features. It would be worth applying mobile chatbots as well as other NLP‐based applications to other professional training programs in the future.

NeuroSim: A Circuit-Level Macro Model for Benchmarking Neuro-Inspired Architectures in Online Learning.,"Chen, Pai-Yu; Peng, Xiaochen; Yu, Shimeng","Neuro-inspired architectures based on synaptic memory arrays have been proposed for on-chip acceleration of weighted sum and weight update in machine/deep learning algorithms. In this paper, we developed NeuroSim, a circuit-level macro model that estimates the area, latency, dynamic energy, and leakage power to facilitate the design space exploration of neuro-inspired architectures with mainstream and emerging device technologies. NeuroSim provides flexible interface and a wide variety of design options at the circuit and device level. Therefore, NeuroSim can be used by neural networks (NNs) as a supporting tool to provide circuit-level performance evaluation. With NeuroSim, an integrated framework can be built with hierarchical organization from the device level (synaptic device properties) to the circuit level (array architectures) and then to the algorithm level (NN topology), enabling instruction-accurate evaluation on the learning accuracy as well as the circuit-level performance metrics at the run-time of online learning.

A competency-based guided-learning algorithm applied on adaptively guiding e-learning.,"Hsu, Wei-Chih; Li, Cheng-Hsiu","This paper presents a new algorithm called competency-based guided-learning algorithm (CBGLA), which can be applied on adaptively guiding e-learning. Computational process analysis and mathematical derivation of competency-based learning (CBL) were used to develop the CBGLA. The proposed algorithm could generate an effective adaptively guiding learning path in order that it would guide the learners to study adaptively without requiring teacher involvement. In order to verify the effectiveness for the CBGLA, a system is implemented. Using statistical methods, the data of which are collected from the students' learning activities on the system, we have verified the efficiency of the CBGLA by the comparison of the pre-test and post-test scores of students. While the learning materials possess fixed scope and could be classified into several categories, students could even learn more effective under the guidance of CBGLA system than a teacher. Analyzing the questionnaire, it also has been shown that learners were very satisfied with the design of the system user interface and the guided-learning mechanism.

We asked students to generate functions for two different products and examined how students taught functional modeling and function enumeration compare to students who are only taught function enumeration. The student responses were examined using a rubric that we developed and validated for assessing function. This rubric may be used to classify functions by correctness (correct, partially correct, and incorrect) and categories (high level, interface, low level, and ambiguous).

Development and Evaluation of Game-Based Learning System Using the Microsoft Kinect Sensor.,"Tsai, Chih-Hsiao; Kuo, Yin-Hao; Chu, Kuo-Chung; Yen, Jung-Chuan","This paper investigates the capability of Kinect sensor as interactive technology and discusses how it can assist and improve teaching and learning. The Kinect sensor is a motion sensor that provides a natural user interface. It was implemented by Microsoft for the Xbox 360 video-game console to create a new control-free experience for the user without any intermediary device. The Kinect sensor can enhance kinesthetic pedagogical practices to profit learners with strong bodily-kinesthetic intelligence (body smart). As a learning tool, the Kinect sensor has potential to create interactive games, to increase learner motivation, and to enhance learning efficiency via its multimedia and multisensory capacity. Many students must learn spatial skills to improve learning achievement in science, mathematics, and engineering. This paper will focus on developing the Kinect sensor-assisted game-based learning system with ARCS model to provide kinesthetic pedagogical practices for learning spatial skills, motivating students, and enhancing students’ effectiveness. The responses to the System Usability Scale indicated that our system demonstrated usability and learnability. We conclude that the Kinect sensor-assisted learning system promotes the development of students’ spatial visualization skills and encourages them to become active learners.

Accelerating Reinforcement Learning using EEG-based implicit human feedback.,"Xu, Duo; Agarwal, Mohit; Gupta, Ekansh; Fekri, Faramarz; Sivakumar, Raghupathy","Providing Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents with human feedback can dramatically improve various aspects of learning. However, previous methods require human observer to give inputs explicitly (e.g., press buttons, voice interface), burdening the human in the loop of RL agent's learning process. Further, providing explicit human advise (feedback) continuously is not always possible or too restrictive, e.g., autonomous driving, disabled rehabilitation, etc. In this work, we investigate capturing human's intrinsic reactions as implicit (and natural) feedback through EEG in the form of error-related potentials (ErrP), providing a natural and direct way for humans to improve the RL agent learning. As such, the human intelligence can be integrated via implicit feedback with RL algorithms to accelerate the learning of RL agent. We develop three reasonably complex 2D discrete navigational games to experimentally evaluate the overall performance of the proposed work. And the motivation of using ErrPs as feedbacks is also verified by subjective experiments. Major contributions of our work are as follows, (i) we propose and experimentally validate the zero-shot learning of ErrPs, where the ErrPs can be learned for one game, and transferred to other unseen games, (ii) we propose a novel RL framework for integrating implicit human feedbacks via ErrPs with RL agent, improving the label efficiency and robustness to human mistakes, and (iii) compared to prior works, we scale the application of ErrPs to reasonably complex environments, and demonstrate the significance of our approach for accelerated learning through real user experiments",2021,10/24/,Neurocomputing,technology,tech_nc,460,,139-153,,,,#4857,Xu 2021,,
Designing Crowdcritique Systems for Formative Feedback.,"Easterday, Matthew; Rees Lewis, Daniel; Gerber, Elizabeth","Intelligent tutors based on expert systems often struggle to provide formative feedback on complex, ill-defined problems where answers are unknown. Hybrid crowdsourcing systems that combine the intelligence of multiple novices in face-to-face settings might provide an alternate approach for providing intelligent formative feedback. The purpose of this study was to develop empirically grounded design principles for crowdcritique systems that provide intelligent formative feedback on complex, ill-defined problems. In this design research project, we iteratively developed and tested a crowdcritique system through 3 studies of 43 novice problem solvers in 3 formal and informal learning environments. We collected observations, interviews, and surveys and used a grounded theory approach to develop and test socio-technical design principles for crowdcritique systems. The project found that to provide formative feedback on ill-defined problems, crowdcritique systems should provide a combination of technical features including: quick invite tools; formative framing; a public, near-synchronous social media interface; critique scaffolds; 'like' system; community hashtags; analysis tools and 'to do' lists; along with social practices including: prep/write-first/write-last script and critique training. Such a system creates a dual-channel conversation that increases the volume of quality critique by grounding comments, scaffolding and recording critique, and reducing production blocking. Such a design provides the benefits of both face-to-face critique and computer-support in both formal and informal learning environments while reducing the orchestration burden on instructors.

For this purpose, initial design principles were used that are derived from the existing pedagogical theories such as Conversational Framework, Constructive Alignment, and Personalized System of Instruction, literature reviews and empirical data. Through iterative cycles of building, intervention, and evaluation of an InfoSec laboratory, and side-by-side critical reflections, this study refines the conceptual model of an online InfoSec laboratory and initial design principles and provides general guidelines on the process of establishing a pedagogically underpinned online InfoSec laboratory for hands-on exercises. This study contributes by serving two major purposes. First, this study proposes a conceptual model of an online InfoSec laboratory that comprises important entities: Laboratory Infrastructure, Exercise (document), Exercise Processing and Management Interface (EPI), and Concrete Exercise Interface. Secondly, the research proposes design principles for implementing a conceptual model of an online InfoSec laboratory in different educational contexts.",2016,//Winter2016,Journal of Information Systems Education,technology,tech_edu,27,1,17-35,,,,#4798,Iqbal 2016,,
On human-machine relations.,"Degani, Asaf; Goldman, Claudia; Deutsch, Omer; Tsimhoni, Omer","This paper presents an approach to human-machine interactions based on the concept of teamwork and the psychological theory of object relations. We envision the human and the machine in a close relationship that has many aspects of human-to-human relations. Not only does the machine have to relate to and accommodate human wants and needs, but also, to some extent, the human is called to reciprocate. We propose a framework consisting of eleven attributes that describe generic processes in teamwork: commitment, goal definition, common ground, belief, planning, transparency, sensitivity, caring, responsibility, trust, and reflection. Using an automotive climate control system as an example, we show how some of these attributes can be used to evaluate user interactions and point to new design opportunities. Based on results from a pilot study of driver interaction with the climate control system, we operationalized sensitivity and caring for other team members, encapsulated them in a computational architecture, and implemented a control interface. The evaluation of the control interface during a driving experiment suggests that it is markedly better than a regular interface and is almost as good as a human expert who interacts with the climate control system in response to the driver's needs and wants.",2017,09//,"Cognition, Technology & Work",science,sci_cog,19,2/3,211-231,,,,#4661,Degani 2017,,
Development and Usability Test of an e-Learning Tool for Engineering Graduates to Develop Academic Writing in English: A Case Study.,Chih-Chung Lin; Gi-Zen Liu; Tzong-I Wang,"Many non-native English speaking (NNES) graduates are required to write academic papers in English; consequently, recent research in the past decade has been devoted to investigating the usefulness of genrebased Writing Instructions (GBWI) on learners' writing cultivation. There is little specific guidance, however, on how GBWI can be employed in online learning environments. The study aimed to design an elearning tool with a Chinese-based interface and to evaluate its perceived usefulness on users' English academic writing development. Needs analysis and GBWI were employed as the main approaches for the system development, for which 32 participants involved in the trail. The results indicate that the participants considered the system useful and helpful while learning English academic writing and extract the design principles derived from the empirical results in the study. The findings provide both learning content developers and e-learning tool designers with developmental insights for graduates to acquire academic writing ability in English. In conclusion, this study contributes to the understanding of GBWI acting on the NNES engineering graduates' development of English academic writing knowledge and skills with the development of e-learning tools",2017,10//,Journal of Educational Technology & Society,education,edu_tech,20,4,148-161,,,,#4611,Chih-ChungLin 2017,,
Closing the chasm between virtual and physical delivery for innovative learning spaces using learning analytics.,"Saleeb, Noha","Purpose: One of the misconceptions of teaching and learning for practical-based programmes, such as engineering, sciences, architecture, design and arts, is the necessity to deliver via face-to-face physical modality. This paper refutes this claim by providing case studies of best practices in delivering such courses and their hands-on skillsets using completely online virtual delivery that utilises different formats of 2D and 3D media and tools, supported by evidence of efficiency using learning analytics. Design/methodology/approach: The case studies were designed using pedagogical principles of constructivism and deep learning, conducted within a mixture of 2D and 3D virtual learning environments with flexible interface and tools capabilities. State-of-the-art coding and scripting techniques were also used to automate different student tasks and increase engagement. Regression and descriptive analysis methods were used for Learning Analytics. Findings: Learning analytics of all case studies demonstrated the capability to achieve course/project learning outcomes, with high engagement from students amongst peers and with tutors. Furthermore, the diverse virtual learning tools used, allowed students to display creativity and innovation efficiently analogous to physical learning. Originality/value: The synthesis of utilised media and tools within this study displays innovation and originality in combining different technology techniques to achieve an effectual learning experience. That would usually necessitate face-to-face, hands-on physical contact to perform practical tasks and receive feedback on them. Furthermore, this paper provides suggestions for future research using more advanced technologies.",2021,03//,International Journal of Information & Learning Technology,education,edu_tech,38,2,209-229,,,,#4683,Saleeb 2021,,
"Connections between e-learning, web science, cognitive computation and social sensing, and their relevance to learning analytics: A preliminary study.","Arafat, Sachi; Aljohani, Naif; Abbasi, Rabeeh; Hussain, Amir; Lytras, Miltiadis","Abstract In this paper we explore the interrelationship between the sociotechnical-pedagogical culture of e-learning, the emerging disciplines of Web science, Social Sensing and that of Cognitive Computation–as an emerging paradigm of computation. We comment in particular on the importance of this relation for the development of learning-analytics discourse. Moreover, we present an initial relational framework between these disciplines and suggest how these relations can be exploited to solve problems in each area. This paper argues for (a) the particular importance of the abstract class of 'learning machines' for Web science, (b) understanding cognitive computation as a necessary practical framework for the increasingly dominating, situated informal learning context, and (c) the potential benefit of Web science frameworks for investigating both, contemporary research questions in e-learning and the development of theories for informal ubiquitous learning. Finally, we argue that exploring links between these disciplines is necessary for improving practical research, for the purpose of developing learning-analytics methodology for evaluating the growing types of modern e-learning contexts such as the informal situated learning context. Highlights • Web Science, Cognitive Computing, E-learning and Social Sensing are connected. • Informal situated-learning is becoming the most prevalent form of e-learning. • Situated learning argued to be significant form of social machine (from Web Science). • Progress in learning-analytics depends on exploiting relations with these disciplines.

AI in Informal Science Education: Bringing Turing Back to Life to Perform the Turing Test.,"Gonzalez, Avelino; Hollister, James; DeMara, Ronald; Leigh, Jason; Lanman, Brandan; Lee, Sang-Yoon; Parker, Shane; Walls, Christopher; Parker, Jeanne; Wong, Josiah; Barham, Clayton; Wilder, Bryan","This paper describes an interactive museum exhibit featuring an avatar of Alan Turing that informs museum visitors about artificial intelligence and Turing's seminal Turing Test for machine intelligence. The objective of the exhibit is to engage and motivate visiting children in the hope of sparking an interest in them about computer science and artificial intelligence, and cause them to consider pursuing future studies and/or careers in these fields. The exhibit interacts with the visitors, allowing them to participate in a simplified version of Turing's test that is brief and informal to suit the limitations of a five-minute exhibit. In this exhibit, the visitor (targeted towards middle school age children) invokes an avatar of his/her own choice, and acts to endow it with human-like qualities (voice, brain, eyesight and hearing). Then, the visitor engages the avatar in a (brief) question-and-answer session to determine whether the visitor thinks that he/she is interacting with a real human on a video conference or with an avatar. We consider this interaction to be an extension of the original Turing Test because, unlike Turing's original that used text via a teletype, this version features a graphical embodiment of an agent with which one can converse in spoken natural language. This extension serves to make passing the Turing Test more difficult, as now the avatar must not only communicate like a human, but also look, sound and act the part. It also makes the exhibit visual, dynamic and interesting to the visitors. Evaluations were performed with museum visitors, both in backrooms with prototypes as well as on the museum floor with the final version. The formative and summative evaluations performed indicated overall success in engaging the museum visitors and increasing their interest in computer science. More specifically, the formative testing, mostly done in quiet back rooms with selected test subjects, indicated that on the important questions about enjoyment of exhibit and increased interest in computer science by the test subjects, their self-reported Likert scale responses (1 being negative and 5 being positive) increased from 3.16 in the first evaluation to 4.38 in the third one for increased interest in CS. Likewise for the question about exhibit enjoyment (from 3.92 to 4.56). The summative evaluation, done through unobtrusive observation of exhibit use on museum floor, indicated that almost 74% of the parties that initiated the exhibit were either highly or moderately engaged by the exhibit. However, there was one major negative finding, namely the overly long duration of the exhibit, which may have caused premature abandonment of the exhibit in several cases during the summative evaluation. These tests and their results are presented and discussed in detail in this paper. The exhibit has been on permanent display at the Orlando (FL) Science Center since June 2014 and has received a strongly positive response from visitors since that time.",2017,06//,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education (Springer Science & Business Media B.V.),education,edu_ai,27,2,353-384,,,,#4465,Gonzalez 2017,,

Brain–computer interface for assessment of mental efforts in e‐learning using the nonmarkovian queueing model.,"Balamurugan, B.; Mullai, M.; Soundararajan, S.; Selvakanmani, S.; Arun, D.","The rapid advancement in information and communication technology has made e‐learning an alternative learning method for many learners. In the last few years, a huge number of learners around the world have registered in massive open online courses (MOOCs) provided by various online learning platforms. However, MOOC platforms have a vital task for the online course provider to provide enhanced students' learning experiences and satisfaction. In this work, we developed a brain–computer interface for gathering data and detecting a learner's mental situation by observing MOOC videos and electroencephalogram (EEG) devices based on John Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory. The acquired EEG signals are preprocessed with two different normalization methods to scale signals. To validate the introduced framework, the system adopted three machine learning algorithms (random forest using non‐Markovian model, support vector machine, and k‐nearest neighbors) to develop a model with preprocessed training data and test the classifiers to validate their ensemble classifiers' performance. Finally, experimental analysis showed that the random forest classifier with the non‐Markovian approach achieved more than the other two techniques in the form of overall accuracy (99.15%) and F‐measures (99.21%).",2021,03//,Computer Applications in Engineering Education,education,edu_eng_comp,29,2,394-410,,,,#5150,Balamurugan 2021,,
Personalized training model for organizing blended and lifelong distance learning courses and its effectiveness in Higher Education.,"Bekmanova, Gulmira; Ongarbayev, Yerkin; Somzhurek, Baubek; Mukatayev, Nurlan","The main goal of this research is to improve the personification of learning in higher education. The proposed flexible model for organizing blended and distance learning in higher education involves the creation of an individual learning path through testing students before the start of training. Based on the learning outcomes, the student is credited to the learning path. The training path consists of mandatory and additional modules for training; additional modules can be skipped after successfully passing the test, without studying these modules. The paper examines the composition of intelligent learning systems: student model, learning model and interface model. A student model is described, which contains the level of their knowledge, skills and abilities, the ability to learn, the ability to complete tasks (whether they know how to use the information received or not), personal characteristics (type, orientation) and other factors. The student's model is described by a mathematical formula. Thus, being described using logical rules, which have formed the basis for the software implementation of mixed and distance learning rules for lifelong learning courses. There is an interface model presented in the paper, and the results of the course of the proposed flexible model for the organization of mixed and distance learning ""Digital Skills of a Modern Teacher in the Context of Distance Learning"", as well as the face-to-face course ""Digital Learning for Everyone"" before the start of the pandemic which is close in its content to the course under study.

"Genetics with Jean: the design, development and evaluation of an affective tutoring system.","Thompson, Nik; McGill, Tanya","This paper details the design, development and evaluation of an affective tutoring system (ATS)-an e-learning system that detects and responds to the emotional states of the learner. Research into the development of ATS is an active and relatively new field, with many studies demonstrating promising results. However, there is often no practical way to apply these findings in real-world settings. The ATS described in this paper utilizes a generic affective application model to infer and appropriately respond to the learner's affective state. This approach brings several advantages, notably the potential direct support for re-use and retrospective addition of affect sensing functionality into existing e-learning software. Skin conductivity and heart rate variability measurements were used to infer affective activation and valence. The evaluation involved an experiment in which the effectiveness of the fully functional ATS was compared with that of a non-affective version, and was conducted with 40 adult participants. The evaluation of the effectiveness of this tutoring system showed that measurable improvements in perceived learning may be obtained with a modest level of software development.",2017,04//,Educational Technology Research & Development,education,edu_ldt,65,2,279-299,,,,#4524,Thompson 2017,,

Generating educational mobile applications using UIDPs identified by artificial intelligence techniques.,"Sánchez-Morales, Laura Nely; Alor-Hernández, Giner; Rosales-Morales, Viviana Yarel; Cortes-Camarillo, Cesar Augusto; Sánchez-Cervantes, José Luis","• A new process for developing educational mobile applications is proposed. • Our process generates mobile applications on different software platforms. • User Interface Design Patterns and Artificial Intelligence techniques were used. • A Web-based tool called EduMatic was developed as a proof-of-concept. Commercial mobile devices vary in brand, size, and functionalities, but they all allow people to interact with educational applications. In software engineering, application development techniques, approaches, methodologies, and processes (e.g., BBD, FDD, RAD, DDD) are often time consuming, costly, or aim at expert developers – which implies that users outside the software development field (e.g., teachers) need great practice to become experienced application developers. This work proposes an artificial-intelligence-based process for generating educational mobile apps from freehand-generated images. The images' design is based on User Interface Design Pattern (UIDP) representations. As a proof of concept, we introduce EduMatic, an application development tool. To test our process, we assessed Wiki-Comp, an application built with EduMatic, along with three other external educational applications: Khan Academy, Wiki encyclopedia, and Kiwix.

SpikingLab: modelling agents controlled by Spiking Neural Networks in Netlogo.,"Jimenez-Romero, Cristian; Johnson, Jeffrey","The scientific interest attracted by Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) has lead to the development of tools for the simulation and study of neuronal dynamics ranging from phenomenological models to the more sophisticated and biologically accurate Hodgkin-and-Huxley-based and multi-compartmental models. However, despite the multiple features offered by neural modelling tools, their integration with environments for the simulation of robots and agents can be challenging and time consuming. The implementation of artificial neural circuits to control robots generally involves the following tasks: (1) understanding the simulation tools, (2) creating the neural circuit in the neural simulator, (3) linking the simulated neural circuit with the environment of the agent and (4) programming the appropriate interface in the robot or agent to use the neural controller. The accomplishment of the above-mentioned tasks can be challenging, especially for undergraduate students or novice researchers. This paper presents an alternative tool which facilitates the simulation of simple SNN circuits using the multi-agent simulation and the programming environment Netlogo (educational software that simplifies the study and experimentation of complex systems). The engine proposed and implemented in Netlogo for the simulation of a functional model of SNN is a simplification of integrate and fire (I&F) models. The characteristics of the engine (including neuronal dynamics, STDP learning and synaptic delay) are demonstrated through the implementation of an agent representing an artificial insect controlled by a simple neural circuit.

Practical ethics for building learning analytics.,"Kitto, Kirsty; Knight, Simon","Artificial intelligence and data analysis (AIDA) are increasingly entering the field of education. Within this context, the subfield of learning analytics (LA) has, since its inception, had a strong emphasis upon ethics, with numerous checklists and frameworks proposed to ensure that student privacy is respected and potential harms avoided. Here, we draw attention to some of the assumptions that underlie previous work in ethics for LA, which we frame as three tensions. These assumptions have the potential of leading to both the overcautious underuse of AIDA as administrators seek to avoid risk, or the unbridled misuse of AIDA as practitioners fail to adhere to frameworks that provide them with little guidance upon the problems that they face in building LA for institutional adoption. We use three edge cases to draw attention to these tensions, highlighting places where existing ethical frameworks fail to inform those building LA solutions. We propose a pilot open database that lists edge cases faced by LA system builders as a method for guiding ethicists working in the field towards places where support is needed to inform their practice. This would provide a middle space where technical builders of systems could more deeply interface with those concerned with policy, law and ethics and so work towards building LA that encourages human flourishing across a lifetime of learning. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Applied ethics has a number of well‐established theoretical groundings that we can use to frame the actions of ethical agents, including, deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics.Learning analytics has developed a number of checklists, frameworks and evaluation methodologies for supporting trusted and ethical development, but these are often not adhered to by practitioners.Laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) apply to fields like education, but the complexity of this field can make them difficult to apply.What this paper adds Evidence of tensions and gaps in existing ethical frameworks and checklists to support the ethical development and implementation of learning analytics.A set of three edge cases that demonstrate places where existing work on the ethics of AI in education has failed to provide guidance.A ""practical ethics"" conceptualisation that draws on virtue ethics to support practitioners in building learning analytics systems.Implications for practice and/or policy Those using AIDA in education should collect and share example edge cases to support development of practical ethics in the field.A multiplicity of ethical approaches are likely to be useful in understanding how to develop and implement learning analytics ethically in practical contexts.",2019,11//,British Journal of Educational Technology,education,edu_tech,50,6,2855-2870,,,,#4365,Kitto 2019,,
Feedback source modality effects on training outcomes in a serious game: Pedagogical agents make a difference.,"Goldberg, Benjamin; Cannon-Bowers, Janis","The aim of this research is to enhance game-based training applications to support educational events in the absence of live instruction. The overarching purpose of the presented study was to explore available tools for integrating intelligent tutoring communications in game-based learning platforms and to examine theory-based techniques for delivering explicit feedback in such environments. The primary tool influencing the design of this research was the open-source Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), a modular domain-independent architecture that provides the tools and methods to author, deliver, and evaluate intelligent tutoring technologies within any instructional domain. Influenced by research surrounding social cognitive theory and cognitive load theory, the resulting experiment tested varying approaches for utilizing an Embodied Pedagogical Agent (EPA) to function as a tutor during interaction in a game-based training environment. Conditions were authored to assess the tradeoffs between embedding an EPA directly in a game, embedding an EPA in GIFT’s browser-based Tutor–User Interface (TUI), or using audio prompts alone with no social grounding. The resulting data supported the application of using an EPA embedded in GIFT’s TUI to provide explicit feedback during a game-based learning event.

Identifying opportunities for artificial intelligence in the evolution of training and development practices.,"Maity, Souvik","Purpose: The fast pace of innovation and disruption in business processes and technology today requires employees of organizations to be continuously up-skilled and be able to adapt to changing practices. Training needs are becoming more personalized. Micro-learning and byte-sized training modules, easily accessible to employees, as and when required, are some of the major organizational needs. Training and development programs should be designed keeping in mind factors of employee engagement, involvement and extent of training transfer. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether artificial intelligence (AI) can lead training and development processes in organizations in the years to come. Design/methodology/approach: The author has interviewed 27 HR and training professionals, in person, from across eight organizations in the FMCG, oil and natural gas and clothing and apparel industries. All these organizations have an annual turnover of greater than US$14.5m. A formal questionnaire was not followed since this research explores a new field in academia. Open-ended questions were used in the interviews, of which eight were common across all interviews. The mean interview duration was 25 min 33 s. The objective being to capture ideas and identify future trends, the analysis was done on a percentage basis and served as the foundation for a new training and development needs model for organizations. Findings: Among the 27 HR/training professionals interviewed, 92.6 percent respondents believed that their organization/department requires knowledge management practices while 40.7 percent require the training content delivered to a fixed category of employees, to be updated continuously. Personalized learning was mentioned as a requirement by 63 percent of the respondents. In total, 92.6 percent HR/training professionals believed training programs should involve high employee engagement. In total, 51.9 percent would prefer on-the-go learning tools for their employees, while 33.33 percent respondents believed an intuitive e-learning interface would be useful for their organization/department. The findings also led to the foundation of an SIP model, which shall be useful in providing direction to AI systems in training and development practices. Research limitations/implications: The paper opens up avenues for further research to be conducted in identifying the areas of impact of AI in training and development. It paves the way for researchers to quantify training effectiveness and measure it with the help of AI. Practical implications: The objective of the paper is to explore the opportunities for AI in training and development practices. Having identified the opportunities, it shall drive the practice of using AI across industries. Originality/value: The thoughts in the paper have been ideated by the authors organically. Relevant data points from referred sources have been cited to back up those thoughts.",2019,09//,Journal of Management Development,education,edu_bm,38,8,651-663,,,,#4379,Maity 2019,,
Guidelines for designing and using collaborative-competitive serious games.,"Buchinger, Diego; da Silva Hounsell, Marcelo","There are already evidences of Serious Games (SG) effectiveness in teaching-learning processes for some areas of knowledge. Some studies analyzed the influence of different interaction modes, with focus on competitive and collaborative SG modes separately. New research studies however, suggest that SG with collaboration and competition altogether, could also provide benefits. A review on Collaborative-Competitive SG (CCSG) was performed, but no methodology was found to design such games. Instead, different research studies claim that specific design features should require attention in the design phase since they may compromise the success of a CCSG in terms of usage and learning. Once the outcome is said to be sensitive to those features, we hypothesized that a CCSG with such concerns altogether still promote learning. Thus, a new CCSG was designed considering all of these features, implemented, put to use and tested. Learning evaluations on a pre-experimental research design showed an increase in knowledge acquisition and level of confidence on students that played the resulting game. Data show that joining all design concerns regarding a CCSG did not compromise game capability to promote learning. Based on the feedback of game use, more features arose and we advocate that they should be considered as design concerns as well. Game design features identified in this work have been proved effective and can be used as guidelines for future educational CCSG.",2018,03//,Computers & Education,education,edu_computr,118,,133-149,,,,#4430,Buchinger 2018,,

Venturing into the uncanny valley of mind-The influence of mind attribution on the acceptance of human-like characters in a virtual reality setting.,"Stein, Jan-Philipp; Ohler, Peter","For more than 40years, the uncanny valley model has captivated researchers from various fields of expertise. Still, explanations as to why slightly imperfect human-like characters can evoke feelings of eeriness remain the subject of controversy. Many experiments exploring the phenomenon have emphasized specific visual factors in connection to evolutionary psychological theories or an underlying categorization conflict. More recently, studies have also shifted away focus from the appearance of human-like entities, instead exploring their mental capabilities as basis for observers' discomfort. In order to advance this perspective, we introduced 92 participants to a virtual reality (VR) chat program and presented them with two digital characters engaged in an emotional and empathic dialogue. Using the same pre-recorded 3D scene, we manipulated the perceived control type of the depicted characters (human-controlled avatars vs. computer-controlled agents), as well as their alleged level of autonomy (scripted vs. self-directed actions). Statistical analyses revealed that participants experienced significantly stronger eeriness if they perceived the empathic characters to be autonomous artificial intelligences. As human likeness and attractiveness ratings did not result in significant group differences, we present our results as evidence for an ""uncanny valley of mind"" that relies on the attribution of emotions and social cognition to non-human entities. A possible relationship to the philosophy of anthropocentrism and its ""threat to human distinctiveness"" concept is discussed.",2017,03//,Cognition,science,sci_cog,160,,43-50,,,,#5620,Stein 2017,,
Intelligent Augmented Reality Training for Motherboard Assembly.,"Westerfield, Giles; Mitrovic, Antonija; Billinghurst, Mark","We investigate the combination of Augmented Reality (AR) with Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to assist with training for manual assembly tasks. Our approach combines AR graphics with adaptive guidance from the ITS to provide a more effective learning experience. We have developed a modular software framework for intelligent AR training systems, and a prototype based on this framework that teaches novice users how to assemble a computer motherboard. An evaluation found that our intelligent AR system improved test scores by 25 % and that task performance was 30 % faster compared to the same AR training system without intelligent support. We conclude that using an intelligent AR tutor can significantly improve learning compared to more traditional AR training.",2015,03//,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education (Springer Science & Business Media B.V.),education,edu_ai,25,1,157-172,,,,#4414,Westerfield 2015,,
An Analysis of the Interaction Between Intelligent Software Agents and Human Users.,"Burr, Christopher; Cristianini, Nello; Ladyman, James","Interactions between an intelligent software agent (ISA) and a human user are ubiquitous in everyday situations such as access to information, entertainment, and purchases. In such interactions, the ISA mediates the user's access to the content, or controls some other aspect of the user experience, and is not designed to be neutral about outcomes of user choices. Like human users, ISAs are driven by goals, make autonomous decisions, and can learn from experience. Using ideas from bounded rationality (and deploying concepts from artificial intelligence, behavioural economics, control theory, and game theory), we frame these interactions as instances of an ISA whose reward depends on actions performed by the user. Such agents benefit by steering the user's behaviour towards outcomes that maximise the ISA's utility, which may or may not be aligned with that of the user. Video games, news recommendation aggregation engines, and fitness trackers can all be instances of this general case. Our analysis facilitates distinguishing various subcases of interaction (i.e. deception, coercion, trading, and nudging), as well as second-order effects that might include the possibility for adaptive interfaces to induce behavioural addiction, and/or change in user belief. We present these types of interaction within a conceptual framework, and review current examples of persuasive technologies and the issues that arise from their use. We argue that the nature of the feedback commonly used by learning agents to update their models and subsequent decisions could steer the behaviour of human users away from what benefits them, and in a direction that can undermine autonomy and cause further disparity between actions and goals as exemplified by addictive and compulsive behaviour. We discuss some of the ethical, social and legal implications of this technology and argue that it can sometimes exploit and reinforce weaknesses in human beings.",2018,12//,Minds & Machines,ai,ai_cs,28,4,735-774,,,,#4408,Burr 2018,,
ReAct!: An Interactive Educational Tool for AI Planning for Robotics.,"Dogmus, Zeynep; Erdem, Esra; Patoglu, Volkan","This paper presents ReAct!, an interactive educational tool for artificial intelligence (AI) planning for robotics. ReAct! enables students to describe robots' actions and change in dynamic domains without first having to know about the syntactic and semantic details of the underlying formalism, and to solve planning problems using state-of-the-art reasoners without having to know about their input/output language or usage. In particular, ReAct! can be used to represent sophisticated dynamic domains that feature concurrency, indirect effects of actions, and state/transition constraints. ReAct! also allows the embedding of externally defined calculations (e.g., checking for collision-free continuous trajectories) into domain representations of hybrid domains that require a tight integration of (discrete) high-level reasoning with (continuous) geometric reasoning. ReAct! also allows students to solve planning problems that involve complex temporal goals. This broad applicability, and the intelligent interactive user interface, mean that students can work on interesting and challenging domains, ranging from service robotics to cognitive factories, leading to hands-on robotic applications. The efficacy of ReAct! was evaluated from three different points of view: 1) the course outcomes that demonstrate its utility in achieving the learning objectives of a research-oriented cognitive robotics course; 2) the user friendliness and usefulness of ReAct! for students, as evaluated by quantitative student surveys; and 3) instructors' experience of teaching the course either with or without ReAct!",2015,02//,IEEE Transactions on Education,education,edu,58,1,15-24,,,,#4407,Dogmus 2015,,
Learning how to write effectively for academic journals: A case study investigating the design and development of a genre-based writing tutorial system.,Hsiang-Yee Lo; Gi-Zen Liu; Tzone-I Wang,"Genre-based writing instruction (GBWI) has been used for English journal paper writing both in classroom teaching and in the development of materials utilizing move analysis and corpus-based analysis. Some writing systems and tutorials have also been developed to improve the writing of non-native English speakers (NNES), as well as to assist academics and researchers for their publications. However, most of these systems had been developed for certain aspects of academic journal writing, such as organizing references, preventing plagiarism, or finding appropriate collocations. Accordingly, EJP-Write , a Chinese-interfaced writing system for English academic journal writing, was developed based on GBWI to teach and assist journal writing in a user-friendly environment. The present study aimed to investigate the perceived usefulness (content effectiveness) and perceived usability (system functionality) of EJP-Write , and identify other factors that might influence user attitudes and continued usage intention. Data was collected via questionnaire ( N = 35) and structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted for fitness estimation on the modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Semi-structured interviews were also conducted to collect additional information for usefulness and usability evaluation ( N = 14). Regarding perceived usefulness, the results show that participants felt the EJP-Write content was useful and effective in teaching genre and move structure because of the aid of various forms of support and examples such as phrase and paragraph templates. Additionally, the learning materials for verb tenses and citation formats were informative and practical for the participants to avoid grammatical and technical errors. However, the move structure provided was limited to the discipline of e-learning and education; thus, move analysis for different fields was suggested. Regarding perceived usability, the citation-related features in EJP-Write were particularly well-regarded. Participants also provided suggestions to improve online editing and outline developing features in the system. Factors found to influence user attitudes, and thus the intention of continued use, were usefulness and usability, while writing anxiety and personalization had less impact. Findings of the quantitative and qualitative data analysis in the study suggest that EJP-Write can play multiple roles inside or outside of the classroom, both as a platform integrating most features essential for journal paper writing, and as a teacher providing guidance and learning materials necessary for this specific genre. It is anticipated that this study will contribute to the knowledge base about both content and interface design for journal paper writing in the discipline of e-learning and education. For program designers of web-based writing tutorials, the involvement of users in the development of move structure could both strengthen various GBWI approaches and solve issues related to disciplinary differences.",2014,09//,Computers & Education,education,edu_computr,78,,250-267,,,,#5592,Hsiang-YeeLo 2014,,
Detecting and Responding to Information Overload With an Adaptive User Interface.,"Kortschot, Sean W.; Jamieson, Greg A.; Prasad, Amrit","The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate an adaptive user interface that could detect states of operator information overload and calibrate the amount of information on the screen.Machine learning can detect changes in operating context and trigger adaptive user interfaces (AUIs) to accommodate those changes. Operator attentional state represents a promising aspect of operating context for triggering AUIs. Behavioral rather than physiological indices can be used to infer operator attentional state.In Experiment 1, a network analysis task sought to induce states of information overload relative to a baseline. Streams of interaction data were taken from these two states and used to train machine learning classifiers. We implemented these classifiers in Experiment 2 to drive an AUI that automatically calibrated the amount of information displayed to operators.Experiment 1 successfully induced information overload in participants, resulting in lower accuracy, slower completion time, and higher workload. A series of machine learning classifiers detected states of information overload significantly above chance level. Experiment 2 identified four clusters of users who responded significantly differently to the AUIs. The AUIs benefited performance, completion time, and workload in three clusters.Behavioral indices can successfully detect states of information overload and be used to effectively drive an AUI for some user groups. The success of AUIs may be contingent on characteristics of the user group.This research applies to domains seeking real-time assessments of user attentional or psychological state.",2020,10/15/,Human Factors,engineering,eng_ergon,,,1,,,,#5584,Kortschot 2020,,

Closing the gender gap in STEM with friendly male instructors? On the effects of rapport behavior and gender of a virtual agent in an instructional interaction.,"Krämer, Nicole C.; Karacora, Bilge; Lucas, Gale; Dehghani, Morteza; Rüther, Gina; Gratch, Jonathan","While numerous research endeavors address the effects of pedagogical agents, the role of the agent's gender and its rapport behavior has been neglected. We hypothesize that a minimal amount of behavioral realism induced by display of rapport is necessary for any social effects to occur in human-computer interaction. Further, in line with results from STEM research on female role models, we assume that especially for female learners a same sex agent will be beneficial. In a 2 (student gender) × 2 (agent gender) × 2 (rapport behavior yes/no) between subjects design, we investigate whether virtual agents can help enhance participants' performance, effort and motivation in mathematics. Female and male participants (N = 128) interacted with a male or female virtual agent that either displayed rapport or no rapport. Our results confirm the expected main effect of rapport. However, against expectations, our results do not support the assumption that a same sex agent is beneficial for female learners. Participants’ performance and effort were significantly enhanced when interacting with an agent of opposite gender that displayed rapport. Our results have implications on designing agents for education and training purposes. ",2016,08//,Computers & Education,education,edu_computr,99,,1-13,,,,#5642,Krämer 2016,,
Multiple Agent Designs in Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems.,"Lippert, Anne; Shubeck, Keith; Morgan, Brent; Hampton, Andrew; Graesser, Arthur","This article describes designs that use multiple conversational agents within the framework of intelligent tutoring systems. Agents in this case are computerized talking heads or embodied animated avatars that help students learn by performing actions and holding conversations with them in natural language. The earliest conversational intelligent tutoring systems were limited to a single agent that interacted with a student in the role of a teacher or expert. Technological advances have since made possible systems in which multiple agents interact with the learner and each other to model ideal behavior, strategies, reflections, and social interactions. Though still an emerging technology, multi-agent intelligent tutoring systems afford pedagogical benefits that go beyond the capabilities of the single-agent system and have facilitated learning gains on a variety of subject matters and skills, including science, technology, engineering, mathematics, research methods, metacognition, and language comprehension. The present work describes some common multi-agent designs that may be used to achieve a variety of pedagogical goals. We provide examples of how these designs have been implemented in educational or experimental settings and anticipate future use within the field of artificial intelligence.

Niakan; Rakhshan, Mahnaz; Keikha, Leila; Saeedi, Marjan Ghazi","With the rapid growth of technology, computer learning has become increasingly integrated with artificial intelligence techniques in order to develop more personalized educational systems. These systems are known as Intelligent Tutoring systems (ITSs). This paper focused on the variant characteristics of ITSs developed across different educational fields. The original studies from 2007 to 2017 were extracted from the PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, Google scholar, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. Finally, 53 papers were included in the study based on inclusion criteria. The educational fields in the ITSs were mainly computer sciences (37.73%). Action-condition rule-based reasoning, data mining, and Bayesian network with 33.96%, 22.64%, and 20.75% frequency respectively, were the most frequent artificial intelligent techniques applied in the ITSs. These techniques enable ITSs to deliver adaptive guidance and instruction, evaluate learners, define and update the learner's model, and classify or cluster learners. Specifically, the performance of the system, learner's performance, and experiences were used for evaluation of ITSs. Most ITSs were designed for web user interfaces. Although these systems could facilitate reasoning in the learning process, these systems have rarely been applied in experimental courses including problem-solving, decisionmaking in physics, chemistry, and clinical fields. Due to the important role of a cell phone in facilitating personalized learning and given the low rate of using mobile-based ITSs, this study has recommended the development and evaluation of mobile-based ITSs.",2021,02//,Interactive Learning Environments,education,edu_learn,29,1,142-163,,,,#4322,Mousavinasab 2021,,
Engineering multiuser museum interactives for shared cultural experiences.,"Confalonieri, Roberto; Yee-King, Matthew; Hazelden, Katina; d׳Inverno, Mark; de Jonge, Dave; Osman, Nardine; Sierra, Carles; Agmoud, Leila; Prade, Henri","Multiuser museum interactives are computer systems installed in museums or galleries which allow several visitors to interact together with digital representations of artefacts and information from the museum׳s collection. In this paper, we describe WeCurate, a socio-technical system that supports co-browsing across multiple devices and enables groups of users to collaboratively curate a collection of images, through negotiation, collective decision making and voting. The engineering of such a system is challenging since it requires to address several problems such as: distributed workflow control, collective decision making and multiuser synchronous interactions. The system uses a peer-to-peer Electronic Institution (EI) to manage and execute a distributed curation workflow and models community interactions into scenes, where users engage in different social activities. Social interactions are enacted by intelligent agents that interface the users participating in the curation workflow with the EI infrastructure. The multiagent system supports collective decision making, representing the actions of the users within the EI, where the agents advocate and support the desires of their users e.g. aggregating opinions for deciding which images are interesting enough to be discussed, and proposing interactions and resolutions between disagreeing group members. Throughout the paper, we describe the enabling technologies of WeCurate, the peer-to-peer EI infrastructure, the agent collective decision making capabilities and the multi-modal interface. We present a system evaluation based on data collected from cultural exhibitions in which WeCurate was used as supporting multiuser interactive.

Recommendations-based on semantic analysis of social networks in learning environments.,"Khaled, Abdelaziz; Ouchani, Samir; Chohra, Chemseddine","The expansion of social utilization within web applications provides a set of social media that allows users to contribute freely and interact with each other. Consequently, E-learning systems have benefited greatly from the concepts of the social web and the emerging technologies of the web semantic, where students and teachers are living and interacting mainly in the world of Web 2.0 and social networks. Especially, the Web semantic provides content that is understandable by machines and Web 2.0, which help to develop collaborative services. Further it can be integrated in a single social structure semantics that could be a good tool to improve the quality of learning. Our goal is to show that these technologies can be adopted to improve the e-Learning user experience and to provide a full automatic learning platform called iLearn. We present a learning environment formulated as a social network, in order to carry out an automatic semantic reasoning including the interactions between users as well as their relationships with the provided learning resources. We merge the analysis of social networks with the web semantics to go beyond the analysis of social graphs by integrating a treatment semantics of the knowledge that they contain and designed by the ontology formalism. iLearn develops two ontologies, the first helps to understand the feeling of users versus resources and recommendations, whereas the second categorizes the different resources. In particular, we present an interactive method of detecting communities to provide students belonging to the same learning community the best learning strategies, the strong collaborators candidates, and the relevant resources that meet well within their needs. • Fully automatic learning framework based on web semantics. • Grouping the users communities by extracting their common and individual interests. • Intelligent recommendations, based on the analysis of the interactions between users and communities. • Capture the underlying semantics of the users feelings and needs. • Guiding learners by recommending the best learning resources and practices.

"Chatbot learning partners: Connecting learning experiences, interest and competence.","Fryer, Luke K.; Nakao, Kaori; Thompson, Andrew","Abstract Conversation practice, while paramount for all language learners, can be difficult to get enough of and very expensive. In this mobile age, chatbots are an obvious means of filling this gap, but have yet to realize their potential as practice partners. The current study was undertaken to examine why chatbots are not yet a substantial instrument for language learning engagement/practice, and to provide direction for future practice and chatbot development. To this end, building on a recent experimental study examining chatbot novelty effects, students undertook a pair of conversation activities: human and human-chatbot (via speech-to-text software). Immediately following the practice conversations, students' interest in the two partners was surveyed and open-ended textual feedback was collected. With these data sources and prior standardised test results, regression and content analysis of the data was undertaken. Findings indicated: 1) prior interest in human conversation partners was the best single predictor of future interest in chatbot conversations; 2) prior language competency was more strongly linked to interest in chatbot than human conversations; 3) that the qualitative experience of having ""learned more"" with the chatbot was strongly connected to task interest, even when reporting communication difficulties. Implications for practicing languages with currently available chatbots, for chatbots and related educational technology as sources of student interest and directions for chatbots future development are discussed. Highlights • Students' experiences with chatbots as language learning partners was assessed. • Interest in Human conversation was the strongest predictor of interest in chatbots. • Seeing chatbots as an opportunity to ""learn-more"" was strongly linked to interest.",2019,04//,Computers in Human Behavior,technology,tech_human_inter,93,,279-289,,,,#4348,Fryer 2019,,
Towards multi-modal causability with Graph Neural Networks enabling information fusion for explainable AI.,"Holzinger, Andreas; Malle, Bernd; Saranti, Anna; Pfeifer, Bastian","AI is remarkably successful and outperforms human experts in certain tasks, even in complex domains such as medicine. Humans on the other hand are experts at multi-modal thinking and can embed new inputs almost instantly into a conceptual knowledge space shaped by experience. In many fields the aim is to build systems capable of explaining themselves, engaging in interactive what-if questions. Such questions, called counterfactuals, are becoming important in the rising field of explainable AI (xAI). Our central hypothesis is that using conceptual knowledge as a guiding model of reality will help to train more explainable, more robust and less biased machine learning models, ideally able to learn from fewer data. One important aspect in the medical domain is that various modalities contribute to one single result. Our main question is ""How can we construct a multi-modal feature representation space (spanning images, text, genomics data) using knowledge bases as an initial connector for the development of novel explanation interface techniques?"". In this paper we argue for using Graph Neural Networks as a method-of-choice, enabling information fusion for multi-modal causability (causability – not to confuse with causality – is the measurable extent to which an explanation to a human expert achieves a specified level of causal understanding). The aim of this paper is to motivate the international xAI community to further work into the fields of multi-modal embeddings and interactive explainability, to lay the foundations for effective future human–AI interfaces. We emphasize that Graph Neural Networks play a major role for multi-modal causability, since causal links between features can be defined directly using graph structures. • How multi-modal representations enable joint learning of a single outcome. • How embeddings can be learned in a distributed manner securely & efficiently. • How to use counterfactual paths for intuitive explainability and causability.",2021,07//,Information Fusion,technology,tech_if,71,,28-37,,,,#4346,Holzinger 2021,,

However, widespread adoption of barcodes requires cost-effective and simple barcoding methods. We here present a workflow that satisfies these conditions. It was developed via ""innovation through subtraction"" and thus requires minimal lab equipment, can be learned within days, reduces the barcode sequencing cost to < 10 cents, and allows fast turnaround from specimen to sequence by using the portable MinION sequencer. Results: We describe how tagged amplicons can be obtained and sequenced with the real-time MinION sequencer in many settings (field stations, biodiversity labs, citizen science labs, schools). We also provide amplicon coverage recommendations that are based on several runs of the latest generation of MinION flow cells (""R10.3"") which suggest that each run can generate barcodes for > 10,000 specimens. Next, we present a novel software, ONTbarcoder, which overcomes the bioinformatics challenges posed by MinION reads. The software is compatible with Windows 10, Macintosh, and Linux, has a graphical user interface (GUI), and can generate thousands of barcodes on a standard laptop within hours based on only two input files (FASTQ, demultiplexing file). We document that MinION barcodes are virtually identical to Sanger and Illumina barcodes for the same specimens (> 99.99%) and provide evidence that MinION flow cells and reads have improved rapidly since 2018. Conclusions: We propose that barcoding with MinION is the way forward for government agencies, universities, museums, and schools because it combines low consumable and capital cost with scalability. Small projects can use the flow cell dongle (""Flongle"") while large projects can rely on MinION flow cells that can be stopped and re-used after collecting sufficient data for a given project.

Distributed learning machines for solving forward and inverse problems in partial differential equations.,"Dwivedi, Vikas; Parashar, Nishant; Srinivasan, Balaji","We conceptualize Distributed Learning Machines (DLMs) – a novel machine learning approach that integrates existing machine learning algorithms with traditional mesh-based numerical methods for solving forward and inverse problems in nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In conventional numerical methods such as finite element method (FEM), the discretization of the computational domain is a standard technique to reduce the representation load of basis functions. Along the same lines, we propose a distributed neural network architecture that facilitates the simultaneous deployment of several localized neural networks to solve PDEs in a unified manner. The most critical requirement of the DLMs is the synchronization of the distributed neural networks. For this, we introduce a new physics-based interface regularization term to the cost function of the existing learning machines like the Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) and the Physics Informed Extreme Learning Machine (PIELM). To evaluate the efficacy of this approach, we develop three distinct variants of DLM namely, time-marching Distributed PIELM (DPIELM), Distributed PINN (DPINN) and time-marching DPINN. We show that ideas of linearization and time-marching allow DPIELM to be able to solve nonlinear PDEs to some extent. Next, we show that DPINNs have potential advantages over existing PINNs to solve the inverse problems in heterogeneous media. Finally, we propose a rapid, time-marching version of DPINN which leverages the ideas of transfer learning to accelerate the training. Collectively, this framework leads towards the promise of hybrid Neural Network-FVM or Neural Network-FEM schemes in the future.

Novel web technologies facilitate the design of web interfaces that support online, multiple-choice questionnaires, while exploiting the storage of tracking data as a source of information about user interaction. This paper proposes an online, multiple-choice sign language questionnaire based on an intuitive methodology. It helps users to complete tests and automatically generates accurate, statistical results using the information and data obtained in the process. The proposed system presents SL videos and enables user interaction, fulfilling the requirements that SL interpretation is not able to cover. The questionnaire feeds a remote database with the user answers and powers the automatic creation of data for analytics. Several metrics, including time elapsed, are used to assess the usability of the SL questionnaire, defining the goals of the predictive models. These predictions are based on machine learning models, with the demographic data of the user as features for estimating the usability of the system.

"CERC: an interactive content extraction, recognition, and construction tool for clinical and biomedical text.","Lee, Eva K.; Uppal, Karan","Automated summarization of scientific literature and patient records is essential for enhancing clinical decision-making and facilitating precision medicine. Most existing summarization methods are based on single indicators of relevance, offer limited capabilities for information visualization, and do not account for user specific interests. In this work, we develop an interactive content extraction, recognition, and construction system (CERC) that combines machine learning and visualization techniques with domain knowledge for highlighting and extracting salient information from clinical and biomedical text.<bold>Methods: </bold>A novel sentence-ranking framework multi indicator text summarization, MINTS, is developed for extractive summarization. MINTS uses random forests and multiple indicators of importance for relevance evaluation and ranking of sentences. Indicative summarization is performed using weighted term frequency-inverse document frequency scores of over-represented domain-specific terms. A controlled vocabulary dictionary generated using MeSH, SNOMED-CT, and PubTator is used for determining relevant terms. 35 full-text CRAFT articles were used as the training set. The performance of the MINTS algorithm is evaluated on a test set consisting of the remaining 32 full-text CRAFT articles and 30 clinical case reports using the ROUGE toolkit.<bold>Results: </bold>The random forests model classified sentences as ""good"" or ""bad"" with 87.5% accuracy on the test set. Summarization results from the MINTS algorithm achieved higher ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-SU4 scores when compared to methods based on single indicators such as term frequency distribution, position, eigenvector centrality (LexRank), and random selection, p < 0.01. The automatic language translator and the customizable information extraction and pre-processing pipeline for EHR demonstrate that CERC can readily be incorporated within clinical decision support systems to improve quality of care and assist in data-driven and evidence-based informed decision making for direct patient care.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>We have developed a web-based summarization and visualization tool, CERC ( https://newton.isye.gatech.edu/CERC1/ ), for extracting salient information from clinical and biomedical text. The system ranks sentences by relevance and includes features that can facilitate early detection of medical risks in a clinical setting.

Investigating a Mixed-Initiative Workflow for Digital Mind-Mapping.,"Ting-Ju Chen; Krishnamurthy, Vinayak R.","In this paper, we report on our investigation of human-AI collaboration for mind-mapping.

Avoiding Help Avoidance: Using Interface Design Changes to Promote Unsolicited Hint Usage in an Intelligent Tutor.,"Maniktala, Mehak; Cody, Christa; Barnes, Tiffany; Chi, Min","Within intelligent tutoring systems, considerable research has investigated hints, including how to generate data-driven hints, what hint content to present, and when to provide hints for optimal learning outcomes. However, less attention has been paid to how hints are presented. In this paper, we propose a new hint delivery mechanism called ""Assertions"" for providing unsolicited hints in a data-driven intelligent tutor. Assertions are partially-worked example steps designed to appear within a student workspace, and in the same format as student-derived steps, to show students a possible subgoal leading to the solution. We hypothesized that Assertions can help address the well-known hint avoidance problem. In systems that only provide hints upon request, hint avoidance results in students not receiving hints when they are needed. Our unsolicited Assertions do not seek to improve student help-seeking, but rather seek to ensure students receive the help they need. We contrast Assertions with Messages, text-based, unsolicited hints that appear after student inactivity. Our results show that Assertions significantly increase unsolicited hint usage compared to Messages. Further, they show a significant aptitude-treatment interaction between Assertions and prior proficiency, with Assertions leading students with low prior proficiency to generate shorter (more efficient) posttest solutions faster. We also present a clustering analysis that shows patterns of productive persistence among students with low prior knowledge when the tutor provides unsolicited help in the form of Assertions. Overall, this work provides encouraging evidence that hint presentation can significantly impact how students use them and using Assertions can be an effective way to address help avoidance.

Visual representation fidelity and self‐explanation prompts in multi‐representational adaptive learning.,"Joo, Hyun; Park, Jongchan; Kim, Dongsik","In their prior research on adaptive instruction for multi‐representational learning, the researchers explored various perspectives on designing visual representations and scaffolds. However, controversies and discrepancies regarding the fidelity of visual representations and self‐explanation prompts have yet to be resolved. This research thus examines types of visual representations and self‐explanation prompts and thereby suggests instructional strategies for multi‐representational adaptive learning. Sixty‐nine college students participated in a 2 × 2 between‐subjects study design (schematic only and adaptively increasing the fidelity of visual representation as well as fixed and fading self‐explanation prompts). Adaptively increasing visual fidelity was shown to be effective for mental model construction. Knowledge inference was most enhanced in the group utilising both adaptive approaches. The increased germane cognitive load appears to have mediated, in particular, the effects of visually adaptive instruction. This research suggests that visually adaptive instruction should include customized self‐explanation supports to ensure successful multi‐representational adaptive learning. This research reveals that sequencing visual representations with increasing fidelity as learning progress in instructional materials and offering fading support for prompts tailored to learning progress are the two effective and complementary ways to ensure customized learning. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Various perspectives on designing visual representations and scaffolds have been taken into consideration to construct optimal adaptive instruction for multi‐representational learning: the varying degree of visual representation fidelity (i.e., schematic up to realistic) and the level of support for self‐explanation (i.e., structured or less‐structured prompts). What this paper adds: Adaptively increasing the fidelity of the visual representations can enhance learners' pictorial constructions of mental models and promote knowledge inference.Fading scaffolding of self‐explanation prompts helps prevent the expertise reversal effect by averting any possible cognitive overload, and promote knowledge inference.Adaptive approach may influence the increase in the germane cognitive load to the most optimal degree to mediate the learning outcome. Implications for practice and/or policy: Sequencing visual representations with increasing fidelity as learning progress in textbooks and other instructional materials, whether analogue or digital, and offering fading support for prompts tailored to learning progress are the two effective and complementary ways to ensure customized learning.The results regarding the effects of visual representation fidelity and self‐explanation prompts can be used to guide the application of adaptive instructional algorithms in intelligent tutoring systems.

Evaluations of an artificial intelligence instructor's voice: Social Identity Theory in human-robot interactions.,"Edwards, Chad; Edwards, Autumn; Stoll, Brett; Lin, Xialing; Massey, Noelle",Abstract This study employs the Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm to extend the predictions of Social Identity Theory (SIT) to human-robot interaction (HRI) in the context of instructional communication. SIT posits that individuals gain a sense of personal worth from the groups with which they identify. Previous research has demonstrated that age group identification is meaningful to individuals' self-concepts. Results demonstrated that higher age identified students rated the older A.I. voice instructor (representing an out-group member) higher for credibility and social presence and reported more motivation to learn than those students with low age identification. Implications are discussed for SIT and design features of computerized voices. Highlights • Age identity matters for evaluations of A.I. voice. • Higher age identified students rated the older A.I. voice higher for credibility. • Higher age identified students rated the A.I. voice higher for social presence and reported more motivation to learn. • Implications are discussed for Human-Robot interaction and design.,2019,01//,Computers in Human Behavior,technology,tech_human_inter,90,,357-362,,,,#4702,Edwards 2019,,

A qualitative research framework for the design of user-centered displays of explanations for machine learning model predictions in healthcare.,"Barda, Amie J.; Horvat, Christopher M.; Hochheiser, Harry","<bold>Background: </bold>There is an increasing interest in clinical prediction tools that can achieve high prediction accuracy and provide explanations of the factors leading to increased risk of adverse outcomes. However, approaches to explaining complex machine learning (ML) models are rarely informed by end-user needs and user evaluations of model interpretability are lacking in the healthcare domain. We used extended revisions of previously-published theoretical frameworks to propose a framework for the design of user-centered displays of explanations. This new framework served as the basis for qualitative inquiries and design review sessions with critical care nurses and physicians that informed the design of a user-centered explanation display for an ML-based prediction tool.<bold>Methods: </bold>We used our framework to propose explanation displays for predictions from a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in-hospital mortality risk model. Proposed displays were based on a model-agnostic, instance-level explanation approach based on feature influence, as determined by Shapley values. Focus group sessions solicited critical care provider feedback on the proposed displays, which were then revised accordingly.<bold>Results: </bold>The proposed displays were perceived as useful tools in assessing model predictions. However, specific explanation goals and information needs varied by clinical role and level of predictive modeling knowledge. Providers preferred explanation displays that required less information processing effort and could support the information needs of a variety of users. Providing supporting information to assist in interpretation was seen as critical for fostering provider understanding and acceptance of the predictions and explanations. The user-centered explanation display for the PICU in-hospital mortality risk model incorporated elements from the initial displays along with enhancements suggested by providers.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>We proposed a framework for the design of user-centered displays of explanations for ML models. We used the proposed framework to motivate the design of a user-centered display of an explanation for predictions from a PICU in-hospital mortality risk model. Positive feedback from focus group participants provides preliminary support for the use of model-agnostic, instance-level explanations of feature influence as an approach to understand ML model predictions in healthcare and advances the discussion on how to effectively communicate ML model information to healthcare providers.",2020,10/08/,BMC Medical Informatics & Decision Making,technology,tech_humanhealth,20,1,N.PAG-N.PAG,,,,#4701,Barda 2020,,

The Use of Artificial Intelligence Combined With Cloud Computing in the Design of Education Information Management Platform.,Qiang Li,"Based on cloud computing theory and service-oriented architecture (SOA) design pattern, a smart education management platform is designed by using cloud computing and artificial intelligence technology. The platform is deployed in the server cluster environment, with Hadpoop managed storage cluster as the data storage center. For the education management, education portal and remote classroom, the corresponding services are launched, which has the advantages of intelligent and efficient, massive data access and intelligent collaborative management. The test results show that the platform can be used normally in the ports of computer, mobile phone and tablet computer, and can successfully complete the basic operations such as user registration and login, educational administration, and content storage. The results of database stress test show that the total time consumption of sequential read, sequential write, random read and random write is 752s, 312s, 968s and 211s, respectively when millions of simulated data are inserted into the database, which indicates that the database can support large-scale data access. The stress test results of content storage service show that when the number of clients is adjusted to 500, 1000 and 3000, the output quantity of each read-write interface can be maintained at about 3500 pages/min in 60s, indicating that the system can still run stably under the condition of high concurrency. The management platform discussed has practical significance to promote the development of intelligent and information-based education management.

Using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-interfaced robotic toys in early childhood settings: a case for children's inquiry literacy.,"Kewalramani, Sarika; Kidman, Gillian; Palaiologou, Ioanna","This study explores the use of interactive Artificial Intelligence (AI)-interfaced robotic toys within early childhood (EC) settings to develop children's inquiry literacy. Arguments about the appropriate role of AI in EC education have received much attention when examining the potential of the integration of technology into children's play and learning. Using Vygotsky's mediation theory (1978) and employing a design-based research methodology, teachers intentionally used AI robotic toys to engage children (4–5 years old) during play experiences. The data from both teachers' and children's interviews, observations and artefact analysis revealed how children creatively collaborated with their peers to create a sustainable city for their robot and 'his' family to live happily. Children's play with the AI robot fostered inquiry literacies – namely creative inquiry, emotional inquiry and collaborative inquiry. This study contributes to research by exploring the use of AI toys together with physical and artificial environments and offers a case to shape children's inquiry literacies. Implications lie in upskilling EC teachers to provide opportunities to play with AI-interfaced robotic toys to foster children's inquiry literacy development process",2021,10//,European Early Childhood Education Research Journal,education,edu_early,29,5,652-668,,,,#4326,Kewalramani 2021,,
